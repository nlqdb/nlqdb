# nlqdb — natural-language databases

A database you talk to. Create one, query it in English. The infrastructure is invisible.

Two user actions. That's the whole product:

1. Create a database (one word: a name).
2. Talk to it in natural language.

Engine choice (Postgres / Mongo / Redis / DuckDB / pgvector / …), schema inference, indexing, backups, auto-migration between engines based on your actual workload — background concerns you never have to see.

## Use it

**One CLI command:**

```bash
nlq login                                               # opens browser, one click, done
nlq "an orders tracker — customer, drink, total"        # creates the DB
nlq "today's orders, newest first"
```

**One HTML file:**

```html
<script src="https://elements.nlqdb.com/v1.js" type="module"></script>

<nlq-data
  goal="today's orders, newest first"
  api-key="pk_live_…"
  template="table"
  refresh="5s"
></nlq-data>
```

That's the whole backend. No SQL, no schema, no API, no framework.

## Examples

[`examples/`](./examples) — minimal scaffolds in plain HTML, Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Astro, plus a CLI-only walkthrough. Each is the smallest valid integration around one `<nlq-data>` element or one CLI session.

> **Status:** `/v1/ask`, `<nlq-data>`, and the marketing site are live. Examples are spec-only end-to-end until the Phase 1 chat surface ships.

## Progress & roadmap

Pre-alpha. The bar below is the path from "Phase 0 backend exists" to
"high-quality production-grade product".

```

Each step is 2–4 words on purpose — full spec lives in
[`./docs/phase-plan.md`](./docs/phase-plan.md) (canonical) and
[`./docs/history/infrastructure-setup.md`](./docs/history/infrastructure-setup.md).

**Critical path right now:** Hosted db.create → Chat surface → Sign-in
UI. The other Phase 1 ◯s (API keys page, `<nlq-action>`, hello-world)
fall out of those three as soon as they land.

### Surfaces at a glance

| Surface | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP API (`POST /v1/ask`) | ✓ shipped | `apps/api/src/ask/**` |
| `<nlq-data>` HTML element | ✓ shipped | `packages/elements/**` |
| `@nlqdb/sdk` TypeScript | ✓ shipped (basic + `runSql`) | `packages/sdk/**` |
| Chat surface `nlqdb.com/app` | ◯ Phase 1 | `apps/web/**` |
| MCP server | ◯ Phase 2 (first in the distribution slice) | `packages/mcp/**` |
| CLI `nlq` (Go) | ◯ Phase 2 (after MCP) | `cli/**` |

Full integration matrix in [`docs/progress.md`](./docs/progress.md).

### Phase 0 — Foundations ✓

- ✓ Worker skeleton
- ✓ KV + D1 bindings
- ✓ Neon adapter + OTel
- ✓ LLM router (strict-$0)
- ✓ Better Auth (GitHub + Google)
- ✓ `/v1/ask` end-to-end
- ✓ Events queue + drain
- ✓ Stripe webhook + R2
- ✓ CI/CD on merge
- ✓ PR preview environments

### Phase 1 — On-ramp (in progress)

The goal: a stranger lands on `nlqdb.com`, creates a DB in plain English,
embeds it in an HTML file, and sends the link to a friend — in under 60
seconds, no card, no config. The waitlist + carousel on the current site
are a holding pattern; they ship away when all four remaining items land.

- ✓ Marketing site (Astro, Workers Static Assets, live at `nlqdb.com`)
- ✓ `<nlq-data>` v0 (live, public `/v1/ask` with anonymous bearer; SK-WEB-008 retired the canned-fixture `/v1/demo/ask` path)
- ✓ Waitlist + capability carousel (holding pattern; removed at Phase 1 close)
- ✓ `apps/web` live at `nlqdb.com` (DNS flip complete, PR #56)
- ◯ Sign-in UI — magic-link + GitHub OAuth (`/api/auth/*` backend ready; requires Resend DKIM/SPF/DMARC)
- ◯ Chat surface — streaming 3-part response, anon-mode (`/v1/chat/messages` backend ready)
- ◯ Anonymous-mode web flow — 72h localStorage token → adopt on sign-in (`/v1/anon/adopt` backend ready)
- ◯ Hosted db.create — typed-plan + provisioner ([`docs/architecture.md §3.6`](./docs/architecture.md)). Unblocks every `<nlq-data>` live claim.
- ◯ API keys page (`pk_live_<dbId>...` per-db, `sk_live_…` account-scoped)
- ◯ `<nlq-action>` writes (signed write-tokens)
- ◯ Hello-world tutorial (canonical entry; satisfied by db.create)

### Phase 1.5 — Trust + Telemetry (gates Phase 2)

The funnel converts and we know *why*. No new infra — the trust UX
sits on the existing `/v1/ask` response shape; demand-signal events
sit on the existing events pipeline. See [phase-plan.md §3](./docs/phase-plan.md).

- ◯ Trust UX baseline ([`GLOBAL-023`](./docs/decisions/GLOBAL-023-trust-ux-baseline.md)): diff preview on writes/DDL · visible SQL trace on every response · refuse-on-low-confidence
- ◯ Demand-signal telemetry ([`GLOBAL-024`](./docs/decisions/GLOBAL-024-demand-signal-telemetry.md)): typed product events on every "not yet" path

### Phase 2 — Distribution (agent + developer surfaces)

Ordered intentionally — MCP first (the 2026 distribution channel),
CLI second, SDK raw-query parity ships with the CLI. Stripe live +
Lago are no longer Phase 2 deliverables; they ship on the §6
monetization trigger, not on the phase rollover.

- ◯ MCP server (hosted at `mcp.nlqdb.com` + local stdio `@nlqdb/mcp`)
- ◯ CLI `nlq` (Go binary; ✓ `nlq run` raw-SQL escape hatch per `GLOBAL-015`)
- ✓ `@nlqdb/sdk` basic methods (`ask` / `listChat` / `postChat` / `runSql`)
- ◯ `<nlq-action>` writes
- ◯ CSV upload
- ◯ Framework wrappers (Next, Nuxt, React, Vue)
- ◯ Docs site `docs.nlqdb.com`

### Phase 3 — Multi-engine engine (the moat)

- ◯ Workload Analyzer
- ◯ Migration Orchestrator
- ◯ Redis as second engine
- ◯ DuckDB analytics path
- ◯ Dual-read verification

### Phase 4 — Enterprise polish

- ◯ SAML / OIDC SSO
- ◯ Audit log export
- ◯ Per-org quotas + budget caps
- ◯ SOC 2 Type 1
- ◯ EU data residency
- ◯ VPC peering

### What's blocking on me (human-only steps)

Things the code can't do for itself. Each block lists the cheapest
trigger to unlock it.

**Right now:** none — PR previews ship via GH Actions (deploy-api,
deploy-web, preview-{api,web,elements}); no manual Cloudflare
dashboard wiring required ([RUNBOOK §6](./docs/runbook.md)). The earlier
"connect Pages git integration for `nlqdb-elements`" item was made
obsolete by the move to GH Actions for every surface.

**Phase 1 — before public soft launch:**

- ◯ Resend domain verification (DKIM/SPF/DMARC for `nlqdb.com`)
- ◯ LogSnag account → drop `LOGSNAG_TOKEN` + `LOGSNAG_PROJECT` in `.envrc`
- ◯ Plausible self-hosted on Fly (web analytics, free)

**Signal-gated — before charging anyone (Stripe live + Lago + Listmonk):**

These ship when one of the [`phase-plan.md §6`](./docs/phase-plan.md)
demand-signal triggers trips, not on the Phase 2 rollover:

- ≥ 5 unsolicited inbound asking how to pay, or
- ≥ 30% Stripe-test-mode Checkout completion over 50 sessions.

Until one trips:

- ◯ Stripe go-live: production keys, Stripe Tax enable *(deferred)*
- ◯ Lago on Fly (self-hosted, free) for usage metering *(deferred)*
- ◯ Listmonk on Fly (self-hosted, free) for marketing email *(deferred)*
- ◯ Apply for Anthropic / OpenAI / Modal / Together startup credits *(non-blocking)*
- ◯ npm publish workflow for `@nlqdb/elements`, `@nlqdb/sdk` *(when v1 is real)*

**Phase 3+ — before enterprise pitches:**

- ◯ Make repo public (currently private through pre-alpha)
- ◯ Submit to Anthropic / Mistral / Bedrock partner programs

### Cost ladder — pay only when someone pays you

**Strict rule: $0/month while there are no paying customers.** Then
add only what is strictly forced by traffic or contractual need.

**Today: $0/month** *(+ ~$85/yr unavoidable for the two domain renewals)*

- Cloudflare Free plan — both zones
- Workers / KV / D1 / R2 / Queues / Workers AI — free tier limits
- Neon — 0.5 GB free, scale-to-zero
- Upstash Redis — free tier
- LLM inference — Gemini + Groq + OpenRouter + Workers AI free tiers; Ollama for dev
- Sentry / Grafana Cloud / Resend / LogSnag — free tiers
- GitHub — free private org

**Triggered by the first paying client (transaction-fee only, no monthly):**

- Stripe live mode — only the per-transaction fee on real revenue
- Stripe Tax — 0.5% per live transaction

**Triggered by specific events (only when the event actually happens):**

| Trigger | Upgrade | Monthly cost |
|---|---|---|
| Sustained L7 attack the free WAF can't classify | Cloudflare Pro | $25 |
| Neon DB exceeds 0.5 GB or needs no-pause | Neon Launch | $19 |
| > 3k emails/mo (≈ 100 signups/day) | Resend Pro | $20 |
| > 5k errors/mo | Sentry Team | $26 |
| > 2.5k product events/mo | LogSnag paid | $10 |
| > 100k Worker requests/day | Workers Paid | $5 |
| LLM bills exceed startup credits | Anthropic / OpenAI direct | variable |
| Usage metering needed (Phase 2 paid users) | Lago + Listmonk on 1 Fly Machine | ~$5 |

The point: every line above is gated on a real signal. **Don't
upgrade pre-emptively.** `docs/architecture.md §8` has the full unit-economics model.

### Open scaling decisions (block large-company customers)

None of these matter pre-PMF. Each must be decided before its phase
ships, not before. Listed in order of when they bite.

| Decision | Decide by |
|---|---|
| Multi-tenancy at scale: shared Neon cluster vs per-tenant compute | Phase 2 |
| Per-org billing, quotas, budget caps | Phase 2 |
| SAML / OIDC SSO for org accounts | Phase 2 |
| Audit log export format + retention | Phase 2 |
| Pricing model above Pro (custom Enterprise) | Phase 3 |
| EU data residency option | Phase 2 / 3 |
| Compliance posture: SOC 2 Type 1 → ISO 27001 → GDPR DPIA | Phase 3 |
| VPC peering for Enterprise | Phase 3 |
| Custom contracts (annual commit, MSA, DPA) | Phase 3 |
| Cross-region DR + backup RPO/RTO | Phase 3 |
| First sales-engineering / customer-success hire | Phase 3+ |
| Bug-bounty program (paid vs credit-only) | Phase 3+ |

## Getting started (dev)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nlqdb/nlqdb.git && cd nlqdb
scripts/bootstrap-dev.sh   # installs everything, pulls Ollama models, seeds .envrc
scripts/login-cloud.sh     # signs you into cloud providers that have a CLI flow
```

What `bootstrap-dev.sh` stands up in one shot (see [`./docs/history/infrastructure-setup.md §8`](./docs/history/infrastructure-setup.md#8-dev-toolchain)):

- **Runtimes:** Bun (package manager + JS/TS runtime), Node 20+, Go 1.24+, uv (Python).
- **Formatter + linter:** Biome (JS/TS/JSON/CSS), gofumpt + golangci-lint (Go), ruff (Python).
- **Git hooks:** lefthook — `pre-commit` runs Biome/gofumpt/golangci-lint/ruff on staged files; `commit-msg` enforces Conventional Commits; `pre-push` runs whole-repo checks.
- **Cloud CLIs:** wrangler, flyctl, aws, stripe, gh.
- **Local LLM:** Ollama + `llama3.2:3b` and `qwen2.5:7b` for offline dev against the LLM router.
- **Env / secrets:** `.envrc` with self-generated `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` / `INTERNAL_JWT_SECRET`, loaded by direnv.

Day-to-day:

```bash
bun run fix          # biome format + lint --write (most issues)
bun run check:all    # biome + golangci-lint + ruff (what CI runs)
bun run hooks:run    # run pre-commit hooks against staged files
```

### End-to-end tests (manual trigger)

E2E coverage is **persona-driven** (P1–P6 from [`docs/research/personas.md`](./docs/research/personas.md)) and **manually triggered** so cost stays inside the free-tier envelope. One top-level `workflow_dispatch` workflow per surface — pick the one that matches the change you just made:

```bash
# From any clone of this repo:
gh workflow run e2e-opencheck.yml                  # web — live LLM via Groq, Neon branch, Workers preview
gh workflow run e2e-cli.yml                        # Go testscript, hermetic
gh workflow run e2e-sdk.yml                        # vitest + cassettes, hermetic
gh workflow run e2e-mcp.yml                        # InMemoryTransport protocol tests, hermetic
gh workflow run e2e-examples.yml                   # Playwright across HTML/Next/Astro/Nuxt/SvelteKit (hermetic)
gh workflow run e2e-examples.yml -f live=true      # + spins up staging for the curl + CLI shell smokes
```

Run hermetic surfaces locally without GitHub:

```bash
( cd tests/e2e/cli && go test ./... )
( cd tests/e2e/sdk && bun install && bun run test )
( cd tests/e2e/mcp && bun install && bun run test )
( cd tests/e2e/examples && bun install && bun run install:browsers && bun run test )
```

Conventions, decisions, persona mapping, cassette governance, and the rate-limit-aware design are all in [`docs/features/e2e-coverage/FEATURE.md`](./docs/features/e2e-coverage/FEATURE.md). Each package's `AGENTS.md` has a `## E2E coverage` section pointing at the relevant tests and the trigger command for that surface.

## Surfaces (planned, Phase 1)

- Web chat UI — single page, 60 seconds from landing to first query, no card required.
- HTTP API — two endpoints: create DB, query DB.
- CLI — single static binary: `nlq new`, `nlq login`, `nlq "..."`.
- MCP server — so agents can use it too.
- `<nlq-data>` / `<nlq-action>` HTML elements — the embeddable backend.
- Plus the platform integrations matrix in [`docs/progress.md`](./docs/progress.md) — Nuxt, Next, SvelteKit, Astro, mobile, server middleware, IDE extensions, no-code, iPaaS, analytics tooling, chat platforms.
