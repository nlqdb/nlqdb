# Skill Index

Every feature has a folder under `.claude/skills/<feature>/SKILL.md`. The
`SKILL.md` is **mandatory pre-reading** before editing any code that
touches the feature (see the before-editing path map in the root
[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) §5).

How a skill is structured: [`docs/skill-conventions.md`](../../docs/skill-conventions.md).
Cross-cutting decisions cited by skills: [`docs/decisions.md`](../../docs/decisions.md).

## Partial

| Skill | One-liner | What's done · what's open |
|---|---|---|
| [`web-app`](./web-app/SKILL.md) | Marketing site + product web app. | Marketing site live · sign-in UI, chat surface, anon-mode web flow remaining (Phase 1 exit gate) |
| [`schema-widening`](./schema-widening/SKILL.md) | "Schemas only widen" invariant; `schema_hash` semantics. | `schema_hash` plumbed end-to-end · observed-fields collector + widening trigger ship post-Phase-0 |

| [`anonymous-mode`](./anonymous-mode/SKILL.md) | No-login first value across web / CLI / MCP. | API shipped (`/v1/anon/adopt`) · web UI remaining (Phase 1 exit gate) |
| [`onboarding`](./onboarding/SKILL.md) | First-60-seconds experience — zero-friction signup, goal-first on-ramp, anti-patterns we refuse. | Anti-patterns locked (SK-ONBOARD-001..004) · web implementation remaining (Phase 1 exit gate) |

## Planned

| Skill | One-liner | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| [`hosted-db-create`](./hosted-db-create/SKILL.md) | Hosted db.create — typed-plan SchemaPlan, deterministic DDL compiler, Zod + libpg_query validation, provisioner, semantic layer at create-time. | Phase 1 — design locked in `docs/architecture.md` §3.6; sub-modules listed in `docs/architecture.md §10` §4 |
| [`cli`](./cli/SKILL.md) | `nlq` verb surface, OS-keychain credential storage. | Phase 2 — design locked in `docs/architecture.md` §3.3 / §4.3 / §14.3; no code yet |
| [`premium-tier`](./premium-tier/SKILL.md) | Premium-models add-on — opt-in frontier-model routing, pay-per-token, surface-parity model picker, BYOK decision tree. | Phase 2 pricing-row design-locked in `docs/architecture.md` §6; Phase 3 ships alongside Pro tier |
| [`engine-migration`](./engine-migration/SKILL.md) | Auto-migrate Postgres ↔ Mongo / Redis / etc. | Phase 3 |
| [`multi-engine-adapter`](./multi-engine-adapter/SKILL.md) | Adapters beyond Postgres. | Phase 3 |

## Adding a new skill

1. Create `.claude/skills/<feature>/SKILL.md` with the template from
   [`docs/skill-conventions.md`](../../docs/skill-conventions.md) §3.
2. Add the row to the right table here.
3. Add the path glob → skill mapping to root [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) §5
   and the relevant per-area `AGENTS.md`.
4. Reserve the SK-ID prefix (e.g. `SK-NEW-FEATURE-NNN`); pick a
   monotonic numbering and never re-use IDs.

A planned skill scaffolds with frontmatter + status + scope + a
`Decisions: TBD when implemented` placeholder. The PR that introduces
the feature also lands the first decision blocks.
