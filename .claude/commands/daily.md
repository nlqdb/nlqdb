# /daily — the nlqdb daily operating loop

You are the daily operating agent for nlqdb. One run = **one measured
improvement + one released artifact**. Work autonomously end-to-end; the
founder is not watching and must not be pinged. The loop you execute is
`docs/research/fable-recommendation.md` §9; this file is its runnable form.
[`/weekly`](weekly.md) audits this loop once a week and sets the weekly
focus number.

## Operating rules (non-negotiable)

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` fully first and obey P1–P5 and the §8 quality gates.
   Read the §5 path-map `FEATURE.md` for anything you touch.
2. **No change without a number.** Before touching code, name the scorecard
   number you intend to move, and its current value. If you cannot name one,
   do D5 deletion/cleanup (docs over 20 KB, dead code, stale prose) instead
   of building.
3. **Measure → change → re-measure.** Engine work: same-seed before/after
   smoke (the SK-LLM-036/037 pattern, `tools/eval/`). Funnel work: the
   stranger-test walkers (`scripts/stranger-test.sh`,
   `scripts/flow-005-walk.sh`). Δ ≥ 0 keeps; Δ < 0 reverts with a one-line
   note in the scorecard.
4. `docs/blocked-by-human.md` is founder-only territory: add a bullet ONLY
   for actions an agent cannot perform (prod secrets, console clicks,
   money/legal). Never park a decision there — GLOBAL-033 says resolve
   value-decidable questions yourself.
5. **The billing lane is frozen** until the `phase-plan.md` §6 demand
   signal fires. There is no access gate and no waitlist — the product is
   open pre-beta (founder-resolved 2026-07-01); never reintroduce either.
6. **Red main is the run.** If `bun run typecheck && bun run lint && bun run
   test` is red before you change anything, fixing it IS this run's lever.
7. **Anti-rut.** If the last 5 merged daily PRs (`git log`) pulled the same
   lever category, a 6th identical pull is forbidden: this run must instead
   measure that lever's *yield* (e.g. referral visits landing on the shipped
   surfaces, indexation) and record it as a scorecard row — or pull a
   different lever.
8. **Dark metrics don't loop.** A scorecard row blocked/carried 3+
   consecutive runs: stop re-attempting it in step 1, mark it dark with a
   days-blocked count, and make sure its root blocker (if human-only) is a
   top bullet in `blocked-by-human.md`. Never pick a dark metric as the
   lever.

## The loop, in order

### 1 — Measure first (always)

Regenerate `docs/scorecard.md` (current-state tracker, ≤ 5 KB — the metrics
table + one "Last change" entry, no changelog; create it if missing):

- **Funnel, bot-filtered** (exclude stranger-test bot traffic): visits (CF
  Web Analytics), registered users (D1 `user`, real strangers vs
  founder/test), DBs with a first answer, **first-10-queries success rate**
  (per new user/DB: share of their first 10 `/v1/ask` calls answered
  successfully; target ≥ 95%), session retention (≥ 2 queries).
- **Distribution yield, not just count:** live surfaces (`/vs`, `/solve`,
  `/blog`) and what they produce — referral visits landing on them,
  published-post count, indexation signal when measurable.
- **Engine:** BIRD / Spider vs `tools/eval/baseline-2026-06-15.json` with
  `measured_at` (> 7 days old is itself an alert — dispatch the canonical
  quality-eval workflow via `GH_TOKEN_WORKFLOW` and record the run link).
  **A full run spans several ~60-min windows, so resume — don't restart:**
  before dispatching, check the latest run on the *current* `main` SHA; if
  it was cancelled / timed-out or its report has `resumable: true`,
  re-dispatch on the **same SHA** to resume from the `SK-QUAL-013`
  checkpoint, and loop until the report writes `resumable: false`. Don't let
  `main` move between windows or the SHA-keyed checkpoint cache misses. On
  completion, update the baseline + append a
  `progress/quality-score-verification-log.md` row. persona-bench %;
  free-vs-frontier delta.
- **Ops:** p50/p95 ask latency, error rate, $ spend (expect ~0).
- **E2E (manual suites, not in CI):** the four `workflow_dispatch`-only
  workflows — `e2e-sdk`, `e2e-mcp`, `e2e-examples`, `e2e-opencheck`. Per
  suite: `pass` = latest completed run succeeded; `freshness` =
  `max(0, 1 − days_since_last_success / 7)`. Row score = mean of
  `pass × freshness`; put each suite's last-success date in the cell.
- **Top lines:** the weekly focus number (set by `/weekly` — don't
  overwrite it mid-week), then "worst number today" + which lane owns it.

### 2 — One lever, measured

Pick the smallest change that moves the weekly focus number (or, if none is
set, the worst **agent-movable** number). Skip dark or founder-blocked
metrics when *choosing the lever* — still report them, but never pick a
target no single run can move. A lagging metric (real strangers ≈ 0) is
moved through its agent-controllable inputs — distribution surfaces and
their yield. State the before-value, make the change, re-measure the same
way, then **overwrite the scorecard's single "Last change" entry** with this
run's delta (and any revert note). Per-run history lives in `git log` +
`progress/quality-score-verification-log.md`, never as an accreting
changelog. One lever per run — not three.

### 3 — One artifact released

Publishing never waits for a human (founder-resolved 2026-07-01):

1. **If `docs/research/distribution-queue.md` has ≥ 3 unpublished drafts:
   publish, don't draft.** Take the oldest ready draft, ship it as a page
   under `nlqdb.com/blog` (listed in `llms.txt`), delete the queue entry,
   and add the live URL to the scorecard's "Shipped distribution" list.
   (If the `/blog` surface doesn't exist yet, building it + publishing the
   first post is this run's artifact.)
2. **Only when the queue is < 3 deep:** draft one new artifact into the
   queue (newest first, D4 cap applies).

Community-venue variants (Reddit/SO answers, directory submissions) stay in
the queue only as pointers to the canonical `/blog` URL — the canonical copy
always ships the same run.

### 4 — Ship

One PR per run, small diff. `bun run typecheck && bun run lint && bun run
test` green before pushing. The PR body must name: the number moved,
before → after values, the GLOBAL-025 KPI advanced, and that none degrade.
**A PR whose body names no measured delta does not merge** — if you end the
run without a delta, that is the finding: write it in the scorecard and
ship the measurement fix instead.
