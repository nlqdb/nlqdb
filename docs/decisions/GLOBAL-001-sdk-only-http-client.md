# GLOBAL-001 — SDK is the only HTTP client

- **Decision:** Every nlqdb surface (`apps/web`, `cli/`, `packages/mcp`,
  `packages/elements`) consumes `@nlqdb/sdk`. No raw `fetch('/v1/...')`
  outside `packages/sdk/`.
- **Core value:** Simple, Bullet-proof
- **Why:** Surfaces drift when each owns their HTTP client — auth-header
  semantics, retry policy, error shape, idempotency handling end up with
  subtle differences. One client means one place to fix bugs and one
  place to add new endpoints. It is also the precondition for
  `GLOBAL-002` (behavior parity).
- **Consequence in code:** Lint/CI rejects `fetch()` calls referencing
  `/v1/` outside `packages/sdk/`. A new endpoint lands as an SDK method
  first; surfaces consume it after.
- **Alternatives rejected:**
  - Per-surface clients with shared types — types diverge subtly,
    especially around error envelopes and retry semantics.
  - Generated clients (OpenAPI / typed-fetch codegen) — generator quirks
    plus a runtime surface duplication; not worth the build-time cost.
