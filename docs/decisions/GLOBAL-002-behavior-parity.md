# GLOBAL-002 — Behavior parity across surfaces

- **Decision:** Every surface (HTTP API, SDK, CLI, MCP, elements, web)
  presents the same auth modes, error shape, idempotency semantics, and
  rate-limit signaling. Surface-specific UX wrapping (CLI prompts vs.
  browser modals vs. MCP tool errors) is allowed; semantics are not.
- **Core value:** Bullet-proof, Effortless UX
- **Why:** Users and agents move between surfaces (CLI in dev, MCP in
  their IDE, web for sharing). If a 429 means "back off 1 s" in CLI but
  "give up" in MCP, behavior is unpredictable. Parity is what makes the
  multi-surface story credible.
- **Consequence in code:** Every error code, every header
  (`Idempotency-Key`, `X-RateLimit-*`, `Authorization`), and every
  status-mapping rule is defined once in `packages/sdk/` and re-used.
- **Alternatives rejected:**
  - Surface-specific error shapes — each surface team optimizes locally
    and the surfaces drift.
  - "Best effort" parity — degrades to no parity inside a year.
