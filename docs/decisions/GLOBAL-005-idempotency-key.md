# GLOBAL-005 — Every mutation accepts `Idempotency-Key`

- **Decision:** Every state-changing endpoint (HTTP, SDK, CLI, MCP)
  accepts an optional `Idempotency-Key` header. Mutations are recorded
  keyed by `(user_id, idempotency_key)` so retries return the original
  response body byte-for-byte.
- **Core value:** Bullet-proof, Honest latency
- **Why:** Networks fail. Workers retry. Without idempotency, retries
  duplicate writes (double-charge, double-emit, double-record). This is
  non-negotiable for any system that bills, emits events, or mutates
  state on behalf of an agent that can itself retry.
- **Consequence in code:** Every `POST` / `PATCH` / `DELETE` in the API
  layer reads `Idempotency-Key`, dedupes by `(user_id, key)` against a
  bounded-TTL store, and returns the recorded response on a hit. SDK
  helpers auto-generate keys for retried calls.
- **Alternatives rejected:**
  - Server-side dedup by content hash — misses semantic duplicates
    (same intent, different timestamp / nonce / client clock).
  - Client retries without keys — dangerous on any critical path; banned
    by review.
