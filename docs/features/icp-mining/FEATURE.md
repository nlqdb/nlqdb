# Feature: ICP Mining

**One-liner:** A Monday 06:00 UTC cron scrapes HN Algolia, Reddit (16 subreddits), GitHub Issues, GitHub Discussions, Stack Overflow, Indie Hackers, and Dev.to; deduplicates via KV; scores 0–10 per persona via Groq → Gemini; clusters into 5–7 themes per persona; writes `docs/research/icp-evidence-<yyyy-mm>.md` to GitHub.
**Status:** implemented (SK-ICP-001 collection; SK-ICP-002 scoring; SK-ICP-003 clustering + evidence file; SK-ICP-004 GitHub Issues; SK-ICP-005 Stack Overflow; SK-ICP-006 Indie Hackers; SK-ICP-007 source-health probe; SK-ICP-008 Dev.to source; SK-ICP-009 GitHub Discussions source).
**Owners (code):** `apps/api/src/icp-scrape.ts`, `apps/api/src/icp-score.ts`, `apps/api/src/icp-cluster.ts`, `apps/api/test/icp-scrape.test.ts`, `apps/api/test/icp-score.test.ts`, `apps/api/test/icp-cluster.test.ts`, `apps/api/wrangler.toml` (cron `0 6 * * 1`).
**Cross-refs:** [`docs/research/automated-icp-validation-plan.md §2`](../../research/automated-icp-validation-plan.md) · [`docs/research/personas.md`](../../research/personas.md) · [`GLOBAL-028`](../../decisions/GLOBAL-028-acquisition-progress-tracker.md) · [`GLOBAL-030`](../../decisions/GLOBAL-030-evidence-grade-acquisition-tracker-edits.md).

## Touchpoints — read this feature doc before editing

- `apps/api/src/icp-scrape.ts` — `runIcpScrape(deps)`; calls HN, Reddit, GitHub Issues, GitHub Discussions, Stack Overflow, Indie Hackers, Dev.to
- `apps/api/src/icp-score.ts` — `runIcpScore(items, deps)`; Groq → Gemini scoring
- `apps/api/src/icp-cluster.ts` — `runIcpCluster(deps)`; KV list → LLM cluster → GitHub write
- `apps/api/wrangler.toml` `[triggers].crons` — must stay in sync with `ICP_SCRAPE_CRON` in `index.ts`
- `apps/api/src/env.d.ts` — `LOGSNAG_TOKEN`, `LOGSNAG_PROJECT`, `GH_TOKEN` bindings

## Decisions

### SK-ICP-001 — Weekly HN + Reddit scrape writing raw items to KV

- **Decision:** A Cloudflare cron at `0 6 * * 1` (Monday 06:00 UTC) calls `runIcpScrape`, which queries HN Algolia (10 pain-keyword searches), Reddit (16 subreddit/query pairs), GitHub Issues (5 queries; `GH_TOKEN`-gated; rolling `created:>` 7-day filter), GitHub Discussions (5 queries via GraphQL; same gate + filter), Stack Overflow (5 tag+query pairs via SE API 2.3), Indie Hackers (5 P1-pain queries via `feed.indiehackers.world`), and Dev.to (5 tag queries via Forem API) for posts from the previous 7 days. Each item deduped via `icp:seen:<source>:<id>` (90d KV TTL); new items written as `icp:item:<YYYYMMDD>:<source>:<id>` (30d KV TTL, JSON). LogSnag `#icp-mining` reports new vs. skipped per source. Per-source `.catch` isolation: one failing source never kills the others.
- **Core value:** Simple, Bullet-proof
- **Why:** Mining public complaints at scale gives the unfiltered language personas use — current persona docs are hypotheses, not evidence. KV storage is free on the Workers tier. Monday after weekend activity maximises signal. 90-day dedup prevents reprocessing while letting long-tail items cycle out.
- **Consequence in code:** `apps/api/src/icp-scrape.ts` is the single owner; `IcpScrapeDeps.fetch` overridable for tests; OTel spans wrap every external fetch (GLOBAL-014). The `scheduled()` handler in `apps/api/src/index.ts` dispatches on `ICP_SCRAPE_CRON` and logs `{ msg: "icp_scrape_completed", newItems, skipped, sources }`. `LOGSNAG_TOKEN` / `LOGSNAG_PROJECT` optional; skipped silently when absent.
- **Alternatives rejected:** Separate Worker (more infra; existing has capacity); R2 (overkill — KV is sufficient; see Open questions); daily cron (weekly is enough for Phase 1; daily burns KV quota on noise).

## GLOBALs governing this feature

- **GLOBAL-013** — Free-tier bundle budget.
  - *In this feature:* all seven sources are free public APIs. Stack Exchange anon quota 300/IP/day; cron uses 5/week. Dev.to public API allows ~3 RPS unauthenticated; cron uses 5 sequential calls/week. GitHub GraphQL primary-rate-limit is 5000 points/hour authenticated; the Discussions search costs 1 point/query × 5/week. Weekly KV cost (≤ 775 items × 2 writes + ≤ 2 list ops + ~775 reads) sits comfortably inside Workers free-tier ceilings.
- **GLOBAL-014** — OTel span on every external call.
  - *In this feature:* per-source fetch spans `nlqdb.icp.fetch.{hn,reddit,github,github_discussions,stackoverflow,indiehackers,devto}` (each with source + item count + status code; GitHub Discussions adds `nlqdb.icp.ghd.rate_remaining`; Stack Exchange adds `nlqdb.icp.se.quota_remaining`); `nlqdb.icp.score` (provider, batch size, raw count); `nlqdb.icp.cluster` (persona, item count, cluster count, provider); `nlqdb.icp.github_write` (file path, written status).
- **GLOBAL-028** — Acquisition progress tracker.
  - *In this feature:* this cron implements §2.1–§2.4 of [`automated-icp-validation-plan.md`](../../research/automated-icp-validation-plan.md). Progress is recorded in that file.
- **GLOBAL-029** — Acquisition verification tracker.
  - *In this feature:* once the first cluster file lands (Mon 2026-05-26), §8 `FLOW-NNN` blocks in `automated-icp-validation-plan.md` get amended with verbatim cluster labels; the mirrored verification blocks gain new walkthrough steps proving the cluster→`/solve/` auto-suggestion path (open question in this feature). Implementation and verification trackers stay in lockstep per the GLOBAL.
- **GLOBAL-030** — Evidence-grade acquisition tracker edits.
  - *In this feature:* ICP evidence and flow-status updates must name the verification artifact (cron output, deployed-surface walkthrough, env inspection, or code/test check) and keep the implementation tracker plus mirror synced before the PR is considered green.

### SK-ICP-002 — LLM scoring of raw items immediately after each weekly scrape

- **Decision:** After `runIcpScrape` collects new items, `runIcpScore` (same cron run) regex-prefilters on pain words, then calls Groq `llama-3.1-8b-instant` (Gemini `gemini-2.5-flash` fallback) in batches of 20 to score each item 0–10 against P1/P2/P3/P6. Items where every persona scores < 5 are discarded; the rest stored as `icp:scored:<YYYYMMDD>:<source>:<id>` (30d KV TTL). The scorer is `.catch`-wrapped in `index.ts` so a total LLM failure still logs and returns cleanly.
- **Core value:** Simple, Bullet-proof
- **Why:** Raw items in KV are not evidence. Scoring on the same Monday run transforms the weekly harvest into a ranked, persona-tagged set that SK-ICP-003 can read directly — no separate data-pull cron needed.
- **Consequence in code:** `apps/api/src/icp-score.ts` is the single owner. `IcpItem` exported from `icp-scrape.ts`. `IcpScrapeResult.items` carries the new items for handoff. `runIcpScore` wraps each batch in an `nlqdb.icp.score` span with `provider`, `batch_size`, `raw_count`. No new env bindings.
- **Alternatives rejected:** Separate scoring cron (needs coordination state for "which items are unscored" — co-run is simpler); D1 storage (migration overhead for a Phase-1 experiment; KV TTL is sufficient).

### SK-ICP-003 — Cluster scored items per persona and write monthly evidence file to GitHub

- **Decision:** After each weekly scrape+score, `runIcpCluster` lists all `icp:scored:*` KV keys (paginated, full 30-day TTL), groups by highest-scoring persona (top-100 each), calls Groq → Gemini to cluster into 5–7 themes per persona, applies the §2.4 rule for `primary_confirmed` / `directional` / `no_signal`, and writes `docs/research/icp-evidence-<yyyy-mm>.md` via GitHub Contents API `PUT` (SHA-aware). LLM-claimed `cluster.count` clamped to actual group size. All external calls: `User-Agent: nlqdb-icp-bot` + `AbortSignal.timeout(15s)`. Non-fatal: LLM or GitHub failure returns `written: false` without killing the cron.
- **Core value:** Simple, Bullet-proof
- **Why:** Scored items in KV are not actionable. The evidence file is the §2.4 ICP-decision deliverable; surfacing the verdict in-file removes the manual check. Direct Contents write keeps the cron self-contained (no git clone, no CI step). KV `list` is free on Workers (1k ops/day; this uses ≤2/week).
- **Consequence in code:** `apps/api/src/icp-cluster.ts` is the single owner; gated on `GH_TOKEN` in `index.ts`. `IcpClusterResult.{primaryStatus, primaryIcp}` exposed to logs + LogSnag. Span `nlqdb.icp.cluster` per persona with `persona`, `item_count`, `cluster.count`, `cluster.provider`. No new env binding.
- **Alternatives rejected:** Separate cron (more entry points, a second KV list op); D1 storage (migration overhead); branch + PR write (over-engineered for a data file); trusting LLM `count` (clamping is cheap).

### SK-ICP-004 — GitHub Issues as an additional pain-signal source

- **Decision:** When `GH_TOKEN` is set, `runIcpScrape` queries `/search/issues` for 5 NL-to-SQL / agent-memory pain queries with a rolling `created:>${isoDate(sevenDaysAgoUnix)}` filter (10 results each). Stored as `source: "github"`, `id: "gh-<issue.id>"`. Unparseable `created_at` dropped. `BOT_USER_AGENT` required (GH REST 403s no-UA). 10s timeout, `incomplete_results: true` logged. Per-query errors caught.
- **Core value:** Simple, Bullet-proof
- **Why:** GH issues are intentional, well-described bug/feature requests from actual practitioners — higher signal than casual social posts. Authenticated GH Search allows 30 RPM, ≫ 5/week budget.
- **Consequence in code:** `apps/api/src/icp-scrape.ts` gains `fetchGitHubIssues`; `IcpScrapeDeps.ghToken` drives GitHub calls. Reddit calls gained `restrict_sr=on`; HN/Reddit/GH all gained a 10s `AbortSignal.timeout`.
- **Alternatives rejected:** Separate GH scraper (unnecessary); unauthenticated GH API (60 RPM; no benefit when token available).

### SK-ICP-005 — Stack Overflow as an additional pain-signal source

- **Decision:** `runIcpScrape` queries Stack Exchange API 2.3 `/search/advanced` (`site=stackoverflow`) for 5 tag+query pairs (P1/P3/P4/P6: `postgresql/setup`, `sqlalchemy/verbose`, `sql/natural language`, `prisma/migration`, `duckdb;clickhouse`), `sort=creation`, `pagesize=10`, 7-day `fromdate`. Stored as `source: "stackoverflow"`, `id: "so-<question_id>"`. Anon (quota 300/IP/day = 60× weekly budget); `backoff` surfaces as `icp_se_backoff`; per-query errors caught.
- **Core value:** Simple, Bullet-proof
- **Why:** Stack Overflow is the highest-density public surface for "I'm trying X with SQL/Postgres/ORM and it isn't working" — P1 setup, P3 stuck queries, P4 ORM verbosity, P6 operational SQL. Listed in §2.1 day one but never shipped.
- **Consequence in code:** `apps/api/src/icp-scrape.ts` gains `fetchStackExchange` and a 4th `Promise.all` element; OTel span `nlqdb.icp.fetch.stackoverflow` carries `nlqdb.icp.se.quota_remaining`; LogSnag reports `SO: <n>`.
- **Alternatives rejected:** Stack Apps key (anon already 60× budget); `/search` (no `tagged`/`fromdate`); polling `/questions` per-tag (burns quota per page).

### SK-ICP-006 — Indie Hackers as an additional pain-signal source

- **Decision:** `runIcpScrape` queries the unofficial `feed.indiehackers.world` JSON Feed for 5 P1-pain queries (`database`, `boilerplate`, `side+project`, `first+paying`, `stack`). Stored as `source: "indiehackers"`, `id: <slug>` from `/post/<slug>`; posts with non-matching URL or unparseable `date_modified` are dropped. Mirror has no server-side date filter; 7-day enforced client-side. 10-second timeout, per-source isolation.
- **Core value:** Simple, Bullet-proof
- **Why:** IH was listed in §2.1 day one but never shipped. Posts are launch-context complaints by definition — gives the cluster step language other sources don't reach. Live probe 2026-05-23: ≈10 new items/week.
- **Consequence in code:** `apps/api/src/icp-scrape.ts` gains `fetchIndieHackers` and a 5th `Promise.all` element; OTel span `nlqdb.icp.fetch.indiehackers`; LogSnag reports `IH: <n>`. No new env binding.
- **Alternatives rejected:** `indiehackers.com` direct (CF bot challenge); Apify ($/run); HTML scrape (brittle); `ihrss.io` (RSS only); IH-canonical resolution (`/post/<slug>` 404s direct — title + `content_html` carry the evidence trail).

### SK-ICP-007 — Agent-runnable source-health probe in `scripts/verify-flows.sh`

- **Decision:** `scripts/verify-flows.sh` ships a FLOW-008 block probing the cron's upstreams; each asserts HTTP 200 + a contract-key (`hits` / `total_count` / `discussionCount` / `quota_remaining` / `items` / top-level array for Dev.to). HN, IH, Dev.to fatal; GH (Issues + Discussions) fatal-when-`GH_TOKEN`-set, else skipped together; Reddit and SO degrade to advisory on `x-block-reason: hostname_blocked` (sandbox-egress proxy 403; CF-egress Worker is canonical). Any other non-200 fails. Per-probe cap 15s.
- **Core value:** Simple, Bullet-proof
- **Why:** A silent upstream schema/endpoint change only surfaces after the cron's LogSnag count drops to zero — days late. An agent-runnable probe makes the failure observable in < 3 s with zero new credentials and closes the data-side analogue of the §1.1 stranger-test gap.
- **Consequence in code:** `scripts/verify-flows.sh` exposes one `fetch_json` helper (severity- and `x-block-reason`-aware) reused by every flow block. Adding a new ICP source extends `apps/api/src/icp-scrape.ts` AND appends a `fetch_json` probe in FLOW-008 AND extends sub-tasks in [`§8 FLOW-008`](../../research/automated-icp-validation-plan.md) — drift is the regression the probe prevents.
- **Alternatives rejected:** GH Actions cron polling (founder-notification channel); Worker `/v1/health` (CF egress can't simulate agent-VM view); failing on Reddit/SO 403 (false-positive every run); marking every source advisory (collapses regression detector).

### SK-ICP-008 — Dev.to as the 6th pain-signal source via the public Forem API

- **Decision:** `runIcpScrape` queries `https://dev.to/api/articles?tag=<tag>&per_page=15&top=7` for 5 tags covering P1/P3/P4/P6 (`database`, `sql`, `postgres`, `webdev`, `orm`); `top=7` is the server-side 7-day filter. Stored as `source: "devto"`, `id: "devto-<article.id>"`; unparseable `published_timestamp` is dropped before KV write. `User-Agent: nlqdb-icp-bot` + `AbortSignal.timeout(10s)`; per-tag error isolation. Live probe 2026-05-25: every tag returns ≥4 fresh articles within the window.
- **Core value:** Simple, Bullet-proof
- **Why:** Dev.to is the largest indie developer-blogging surface; the prior 5-source mix under-samples first-person long-form complaints (HN/Reddit comments skew short, GH issues skew bug-report, IH posts skew launch-context). The Forem API is first-class public read ([`developers.forem.com`](https://developers.forem.com/api/v1)) — no auth, server-side recency, robots.txt explicitly allows `/api/*`. `top=7` is sharper than IH's client-side filter.
- **Consequence in code:** `apps/api/src/icp-scrape.ts` gains `fetchDevto` and a 6th `Promise.all` element. OTel span `nlqdb.icp.fetch.devto` carries `nlqdb.icp.items` and `http.response.status_code`. LogSnag reports `DEV: <n>`. `scripts/verify-flows.sh` gains a `FLOW-008 source Dev.to` probe (fatal severity; Dev.to is Heroku + CF CDN, no egress-block surface). No env binding.
- **Alternatives rejected:** Lobste.rs `/t/<tag>.json` (robots.txt `User-agent: * Disallow: /` + `Content-Signal: ai-input=no`); Dev.to `/search` (robots.txt disallows `/search?q=*`); per-article body fetch (description is enough for cluster input; bodies burn quota); client-side date filter (`top=7` is sharper); `dev.to/feed` RSS (no tag scoping).

### SK-ICP-009 — GitHub Discussions as the 7th pain-signal source via GraphQL

- **Decision:** When `GH_TOKEN` is set, `runIcpScrape` POSTs `api.github.com/graphql` with `search(query: $q, type: DISCUSSION, first: 10)` for 5 P1/P2/P4/P6 queries (`text to sql`, `natural language database`, `agent memory store`, `prisma migration`, `supabase setup`), augmented with the same `created:>${isoDate(sevenDaysAgoUnix)}` filter SK-ICP-004 uses. Stored as `source: "github_discussions"`, `id: "ghd-<node.id>"` (prefix prevents collision with `gh-<issue.id>`). Unparseable `createdAt` is dropped; a GraphQL `errors` body is a soft failure isolated from the 6 other sources. Shares `BOT_USER_AGENT`, `FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS` (10s), `runSpan`, `isoDate`. Live probe 2026-05-31: `discussionCount=8478` for "text to sql"; `created:>2026-05-24` returns 9 fresh discussions including `moorcheh-ai/memanto/discussions/564 — "How are you handling persistent memory in your CrewAI workflows?"` (P2 quote prior sources never caught). `rateLimit.cost=1` × 5/week against 5000-pt/hr.
- **Core value:** Simple, Bullet-proof
- **Why:** Discussions are where Supabase/Drizzle/Prisma/CrewAI/LangChain/Vercel route "I'm stuck on X" questions; Issues only catches the bug-report subset. The prior 6-source mix under-samples **P2 (agent builder)** — CrewAI/LangChain/Mem0/vector-DB Discussions are exactly the long-form P2 signal the cluster step needs. The `GH_TOKEN` SK-ICP-004 already uses authorises GraphQL `DISCUSSION` (no new scope).
- **Consequence in code:** `apps/api/src/icp-scrape.ts` gains `fetchGitHubDiscussions` and a 7th `Promise.all` element (gated on `deps.ghToken`, same isolation as Issues). Span `nlqdb.icp.fetch.github_discussions` carries source + item count + status code + `nlqdb.icp.ghd.rate_remaining` (no second API hit). LogSnag adds `GHD: <n>` between `GH:` and `SO:`. `scripts/verify-flows.sh` FLOW-008 gains a `POST /graphql` probe inside the existing `GH_TOKEN` block, asserting `"discussionCount"`. Tests pin POST + Bearer + bot UA + `DISCUSSION` body + `created:>` filter; absent-token short-circuit; GraphQL-error soft failure; unparseable-`createdAt` drop.
- **Alternatives rejected:** REST `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/discussions` (no global search; per-repo enumeration burns quota); REST Search (no `type:discussion` — GraphQL-only as of 2026-05); more Issues queries (different surface — Issues skews bug, Discussions skews Q&A); a separate `GHD_TOKEN` (`GH_TOKEN`'s `public_repo` already returns DISCUSSION); fetching comments (`node.body` is enough).

## Open questions / known unknowns

- **R2 upgrade** — When evidence files exceed KV practical limits, migrate raw storage from KV to `r2://nlqdb-icp-raw/`. Free tier for both; KV is the simpler path for now.
- **IH canonical URL recovery** — SK-ICP-006 stores the `feed.indiehackers.world/post/<slug>` URL which 404s on direct GET; cluster cites title + first 500 chars of `content_html` instead. If §3.6 reply-to-pain needs IH-canonical URLs, parse them from `content_html` (occasionally carries an `indiehackers.com` link); otherwise "good enough" for cluster input.
- **LogSnag threshold alert** — Verdict already surfaces in the evidence markdown + `icp_cluster_completed` log. A channel-bell event on transition into `primary_confirmed` is the natural next slice; embedding in the per-run line for now avoids double-spam.
