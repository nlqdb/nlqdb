# Feature: Sdk

**One-liner:** `@nlqdb/sdk` — the only HTTP client; browser-cookie vs server-bearer; auto-refresh.
**Status:** implemented
**Owners (code):** `packages/sdk/**`
**Cross-refs:** docs/architecture.md §3.1 (code-surfaces matrix) · `docs/features/ask-pipeline/FEATURE.md` (HTTP API happy path) · docs/architecture.md §3 (TypeScript SDK row) · packages/sdk/README.md

## Touchpoints — read this feature before editing

- `packages/sdk/**`

## Decisions

### SK-SDK-001 — Two mutually-exclusive auth modes, picked at construction time

- **Decision:** `createClient()` accepts either `{ apiKey }` (server-only bearer) or `{ withCredentials: true }` (browser cookie). Passing both is a runtime error; passing neither leaves the call unauthenticated (anonymous-mode path). The discriminated-union types enforce this at compile time and the runtime guard catches `as any` escapes.
- **Core value:** Seamless auth, Bullet-proof, Simple
- **Why:** A bearer key shipped to a browser bundle is a leak. A cookie attached server-side breaks for headless callers. Forcing the choice at construction time makes mis-use a build error or a first-call error, never a silent leak. It is also the precondition for `GLOBAL-002` parity (every surface picks one of these two modes; the SDK refuses to muddle them).
- **Consequence in code:** `packages/sdk/src/client.ts` exports a discriminated-union `ClientConfig`; the constructor throws `NlqdbApiError({ code: "config_invalid" })` if both fields are set; README explicitly forbids passing `apiKey` from a browser bundle. Surfaces (`apps/web`, `packages/elements`) use `withCredentials`; CLI / MCP / events-worker use `apiKey`.
- **Alternatives rejected:**
  - Single `auth` field that auto-detects environment — the detection is fragile (Workers, Bun, Edge runtimes all look "server-ish") and a wrong guess silently leaks the key.
  - Two separate exports (`createBrowserClient` / `createServerClient`) — doubles the API surface for no semantic gain; we keep one export with one config shape.

### SK-SDK-002 — Every method throws `NlqdbApiError` on every failure path

- **Decision:** Every public method on the client throws a single error class — `NlqdbApiError` — for non-2xx responses, network failures, aborts, and non-JSON proxy bodies. Callers discriminate on `err.code` (a string union mirroring the API's `error.status` plus a small set of SDK-only sentinels: `network_error`, `aborted`, `non_json_response`, `unknown_error`).
- **Core value:** Bullet-proof, Simple, Effortless UX
- **Why:** Mixed return shapes (`{ data, error }` vs. throw) push branching logic into every caller, drift between methods, and lose `Promise` ergonomics (`await` no longer means "got a result"). One throw + one error class + one discriminant string keeps caller code small and parity (`GLOBAL-002`) trivial: every surface maps the same `code` to the same UX.
- **Consequence in code:** `packages/sdk/src/errors.ts` exports `NlqdbApiError` with `code`, `httpStatus`, and `body` fields. Tests cover every code path including transport failures (`httpStatus === 0`). Callers `switch (err.code)` — never parse `err.message`. Non-JSON response bodies are deliberately not echoed into `err.message` (proxy/CDN internals could leak); only `code: "non_json_response"` and the HTTP status surface.
- **Alternatives rejected:**
  - `Result<T, E>` return tuples — fights against `await`, doubles the call-site code, and library users have to remember which methods return tuples.
  - Multiple error classes (`NetworkError`, `RateLimitError`, …) — `instanceof` chains drift; one class with a string discriminant is easier to maintain and forward-compatible.
- **Source:** canonical here · also referenced in `packages/sdk/README.md` ("Errors")

### SK-SDK-003 — `AbortSignal` is plumbed end-to-end on every method

- **Decision:** Every method on the client accepts `{ signal?: AbortSignal }` and threads it into the underlying `fetch`. An aborted call throws `NlqdbApiError({ code: "aborted", httpStatus: 0 })`.
- **Core value:** Effortless UX, Honest latency, Bullet-proof
- **Why:** Long-running calls (`/v1/ask` against cold caches) outlive the user's intent — they navigate away, change tabs, retype. Without abort plumbing, in-flight requests keep burning rate-limit budget and the surface re-renders stale results when they finally resolve. Aborts also let the live-trace UI (`GLOBAL-011`) cancel cleanly when the user starts a new question.
- **Consequence in code:** Every method signature exposes `signal?` in its options object. The fetch wrapper passes it through unchanged. Tests cover the abort path explicitly; CI rejects new methods that omit the signal parameter.
- **Alternatives rejected:**
  - Library-managed timeouts (no signal) — surfaces want different timeouts per surface; one-size timeout is wrong everywhere.
  - Cancellation tokens (custom type) — `AbortSignal` is the platform primitive; rolling our own multiplies the number of cancel surfaces a caller has to learn.

### SK-SDK-004 — Zero deps, runtime-agnostic, only depends on global `fetch`

- **Decision:** `@nlqdb/sdk` has zero runtime dependencies. It assumes a global `fetch` (browsers, Node ≥ 18, Bun, Cloudflare Workers, Deno) and nothing else. No bundled polyfill, no `node-fetch` shim.
- **Core value:** Free, Simple, Bullet-proof
- **Why:** Every dep on the critical path is one more way the SDK can break, get a CVE, or bloat the bundle. The Workers free-tier ceiling (`GLOBAL-013`) means every byte counts on `apps/api` and on `packages/elements`. Zero deps is the most aggressive defense.
- **Consequence in code:** `packages/sdk/package.json` has empty `dependencies`. CI fails any PR that adds one. The bundle is < ~5 KB gzipped on the published path. New helpers go inline; if a feature genuinely needs a library, it goes in a sibling package, not the SDK.
- **Alternatives rejected:**
  - Bundle a `fetch` polyfill for Node 16- — Node 18 has been LTS for years; we don't carry that ballast.
  - Adopt `ky` / `axios` for retry helpers — we control the retry semantics ourselves (`SK-SDK-005`); a library would hide them.

### SK-SDK-005 — Refresh-on-401 retries silently; surfaces never see a 401

- **Decision:** When a `withCredentials` call returns 401, the SDK calls `POST /v1/auth/refresh` once and retries the original request. If refresh succeeds, the original 401 never surfaces. If refresh fails, the SDK throws `NlqdbApiError({ code: "unauthorized" })`; the surface is responsible for re-initiating the seamless re-auth path (web: `/sign-in?return_to=…`; CLI: re-runs device flow).
- **Core value:** Seamless auth, Effortless UX, Bullet-proof
- **Why:** A user-visible 401 is a regression (`GLOBAL-009`). Refresh logic in every surface drifts; centralizing it in the SDK is the only way parity (`GLOBAL-002`) holds. The retry is one — never a loop — to bound the worst case at "one extra round-trip".
- **Consequence in code:** `packages/sdk/src/fetch.ts` wraps every call with the 401-refresh-retry. The bearer-key path does not refresh (server keys are rotated, not refreshed). Tests cover refresh-success, refresh-fail, and the "refresh response itself returns 401" deadlock.
- **Alternatives rejected:**
  - Per-surface refresh logic — drifts across web / CLI / MCP within a quarter; contradicts `GLOBAL-002`.
  - Aggressive proactive refresh (refresh before expiry on every call) — wastes the auth server's budget and still doesn't catch revocation events.

### SK-SDK-006 — Auto-generate `Idempotency-Key` for retried mutations

- **Decision:** Every mutating helper (`postChat`, anything that POSTs / PATCHes / DELETEs) accepts an optional `idempotencyKey`. If the caller doesn't supply one and the SDK retries the call (network error, transient 5xx), it auto-generates a key the first time and reuses it across retries.
- **Core value:** Bullet-proof, Honest latency
- **Why:** The API requires `Idempotency-Key` on every mutation (`GLOBAL-005`). Asking surface authors to generate one for every call is the path to "client retries without keys" which the GLOBAL explicitly bans. The SDK generating it once-and-reusing-it on retry keeps the contract intact without surface-level ceremony.
- **Consequence in code:** Mutating methods accept `idempotencyKey?: string`. The retry path memoizes the key on the first attempt. CI checks every new mutating method for the parameter. Bearer-key callers (`apps/events-worker`, CLI) are encouraged to pass deterministic keys (job-id, command-hash) for cross-process replay safety.
- **Alternatives rejected:**
  - Make `idempotencyKey` required — surfaces that don't retry don't need to think about it; required adds friction for the 80% case.
  - Hash the request body as the key — misses semantic duplicates (same intent, different timestamp / nonce / client clock); `GLOBAL-005` rejects this explicitly.

### SK-SDK-007 — `onTrace` hook surfaces ask-pipeline trace events to the caller

- **Decision:** The SDK exposes an `onTrace?: (event: TraceEvent) => void` option on `ask()`. Every ask-pipeline step (`cache_lookup`, `plan`, `validate`, `exec`, `summarize`) fires a typed event when it begins and ends, with timings. Surfaces wire `onTrace` into their UI.
- **Core value:** Honest latency, Effortless UX
- **Why:** The "live trace" requirement (`GLOBAL-011`) means every surface needs the same per-step timing data. A bespoke streaming protocol per surface is fragmentation; one typed callback in the SDK is the single source of truth.
- **Consequence in code:** `packages/sdk/src/types.ts` defines `TraceEvent`. `apps/web` chat panel and `apps/cli` TTY trace both consume `onTrace`. New ask-pipeline steps add their event to the type union in the same PR.
- **Alternatives rejected:**
  - Surface-specific SSE wiring — duplicates parsing logic on every surface.
  - Polling an OTel endpoint — too much round-trip latency; `onTrace` is fire-and-forget local.

### SK-SDK-008 — Wire-layer retry loop on transport failures + transient 5xx (GLOBAL-022)

- **Decision:** Every method on the client wraps its single-attempt fetch in a 3-attempt loop. Retries fire on transport failure (`fetcher` throws, `code: "network_error"`) and transient 5xx (`httpStatus ∈ [500, 600)`). 4xx caller errors and `code: "aborted"` surface immediately — retry can't fix bad input or undo the caller's cancel. Mutations (any non-GET) auto-generate an `Idempotency-Key` (32-hex `randomId()`) before the first attempt if the caller didn't supply one; the same key is reused across retries so the API's dedupe store collapses retries to a single side-effect. The caller's explicit `idempotencyKey` (currently on `createDatabase`) takes precedence.
- **Core value:** Bullet-proof, Honest latency
- **Why:** GLOBAL-022 requires the SDK layer to absorb wire-level transients independently of server-side retries — the server can't recover from a TCP reset on the way back, and non-SDK callers (future Python / Go SDKs, raw curl) lose parity (`GLOBAL-002`) without wire-layer retry. SK-SDK-006 already required Idempotency-Key reuse on retry; this decision codifies *when* the SDK retries (recoverable failure classes) and *how* (the same key threads across attempts). The retry budget aligns with the server's per-stage 3-attempt budget so end-to-end transient resilience is high without unbounded loops.
- **Consequence in code:** `packages/sdk/src/index.ts` `call<T>` runs up to `SDK_MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3`. `sendOnce` is the single-attempt primitive; `isRecoverable(err)` classifies; `randomId()` generates the auto-key for mutations; `mergeHeaders` lower-cases header keys so the dedupe lookup is case-stable. The 401 path stays single-retry per SK-SDK-005 — refresh-on-401 is a different recovery class and the Idempotency-Key reuse semantics differ. Streaming (`askStream`) is intentionally not wrapped: mid-stream retries would re-fire side-effects already in flight; the buffered `ask()` path is the GLOBAL-022 surface for mutations.
- **Alternatives rejected:**
  - Retry every error class including 4xx — masks caller bugs.
  - Skip auto-key generation, require callers to supply one — surfaces that don't retry don't need to think about it; auto-gen keeps the contract intact without ceremony (SK-SDK-006 lesson).
  - Apply retry to streaming too — mid-stream retries re-fire side-effects. Stream callers own their own resume / cancel.

### SK-SDK-009 — `runSql()` raw-query method; SDK-side counterpart of `nlq run` and `/v1/run`

- **Decision:** The SDK exposes `runSql({ db, sql, signal?, idempotencyKey? }): Promise<{ rows: Row[]; rowCount: number; trace: Trace }>`. It POSTs to `/v1/run` (the raw-SQL escape-hatch endpoint corresponding to CLI `nlq run` per `SK-CLI-003`). The endpoint accepts the same constrained read/write verb list as `/v1/ask` (`SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE / WITH / EXPLAIN / SHOW`). DDL is still rejected on this path; DDL only happens via the typed-plan compiler.
- **Core value:** Creative, Bullet-proof, Goal-first
- **Why:** [`GLOBAL-015`](../../decisions/GLOBAL-015-power-user-escape-hatch.md) requires an escape hatch on every surface. The CLI ships `nlq run` (`SK-CLI-003`); without an SDK counterpart the SDK becomes the NL-only surface — exactly the trap `GLOBAL-015` warns against — and `apps/web`, `packages/elements`, `packages/mcp` lose access to raw SQL. `GLOBAL-002` and `GLOBAL-003` make this a parity requirement, not an option. The endpoint reuses the existing SQL allow-list + executor; only the LLM steps are bypassed, so the safety surface is the same one already shipped.
- **Consequence in code:** `packages/sdk/src/index.ts` adds `runSql` alongside `ask`. The request shape is `{ db: string; sql: string; idempotencyKey?: string }`; the response shape includes the same `trace` block specified by [`SK-TRUST-002`](../trust-ux/FEATURE.md) — even raw-SQL responses must carry the compiled SQL + plan-id + cache-hit flag so surfaces don't have to special-case the escape-hatch path. `runSql` is a mutating helper (it may run an `INSERT`); `SK-SDK-006` Idempotency-Key auto-generation applies. The wire-layer retry loop (`SK-SDK-008`) applies. The 401 silent-refresh (`SK-SDK-005`) applies. Bearer-key callers (CLI, events-worker) and `withCredentials` callers (web) both work through the same method.
- **Alternatives rejected:**
  - Expose raw SQL only through the CLI — contradicts `GLOBAL-002`; forces web / MCP / embed users to drop down to the CLI for an escape hatch they ought to have in the same SDK they already use.
  - Allow DDL through `/v1/run` — contradicts `architecture.md §3.6.5` validator split; widens the prompt-injection surface and breaks the "DDL only via typed-plan compiler" invariant.
  - Two methods (`runSelect` + `runMutation`) — the SQL allow-list is already the discriminator; doubling the method surface adds no semantic value and breaks the GLOBAL-017 "one way to do each thing" rule.

## GLOBALs governing this feature

Canonical text in [`docs/decisions/`](../../decisions/) (one file per GLOBAL; index in [`docs/decisions.md`](../../decisions.md)). The list below names the rules that constrain this feature; any feature-local commentary is nested under the rule.

- **GLOBAL-001** — SDK is the only HTTP client.
- **GLOBAL-002** — Behavior parity across surfaces.
- **GLOBAL-003** — New capabilities ship to all surfaces in one PR.
  - *In this feature:* `runSql()` (`SK-SDK-009`) ships in the same PR as CLI `nlq run` and any `/v1/run` HTTP-surface change — no surface lags.
- **GLOBAL-005** — Every mutation accepts `Idempotency-Key`.
- **GLOBAL-009** — Tokens refresh silently — never surface a 401.
- **GLOBAL-012** — Errors are one sentence with the next action.
- **GLOBAL-014** — OTel span on every external call (DB, LLM, HTTP, queue).
- **GLOBAL-015** — Power users always have an escape hatch (raw SQL/Mongo/connection string).
  - *In this feature:* the canonical SDK implementation is `SK-SDK-009`'s `runSql()`.
- **GLOBAL-022** — Recoverable failures retry to success — never surface a fixable error.
  - *In this feature:* see `SK-SDK-008` for the canonical implementation. `packages/sdk/src/index.ts` `call<T>` is the wire-layer retry loop (transport failures + transient 5xx, up to 3 attempts, reusing the auto-generated `Idempotency-Key` from `SK-SDK-006`). The 401 path stays single-retry per `SK-SDK-005`.
- **GLOBAL-023** — Trust UX baseline.
  - *In this feature:* both `ask()` and `runSql()` responses include the `trace` block (`SK-TRUST-002`); surfaces render it.

## Open questions / known unknowns

- **`runSql()` implementation slice.** `SK-SDK-009` is design-locked; the implementation lands together with the CLI `nlq run` slice + the `/v1/run` HTTP endpoint per `GLOBAL-003` (Phase 2, see [`phase-plan.md §4`](../../phase-plan.md)). Until then, callers needing raw SQL drop to the CLI. PR description for the implementing slice must touch all three surfaces.
- **SSE consumer for `/v1/ask`.** The README explicitly notes this is not yet shipped (`ask()` calls the buffered JSON path). Decision deferred until the trace-streaming UX in `apps/web` requires it; the `onTrace` hook (SK-SDK-007) will be the consumer.
- **Bundle-size budget enforcement.** `GLOBAL-013` caps the Workers bundle at 3 MiB compressed but doesn't pin a per-package budget for `@nlqdb/sdk`. Implicit target is < ~5 KB gzipped; should we land an explicit CI assertion?
- **Python / Go / Rust SDKs.** `docs/architecture.md §3` lists them as Phase 2. We have not yet decided whether they share this feature or earn their own (`SK-SDK-PY-NNN` etc.). Revisit when the Python SDK starts.
- **`engine?` on Rust + Ruby SDK `db.create` (W3, GLOBAL-003 gap).** TS SDK lands `engine?` per `SK-DB-010` in W3. `packages/nlqdb-rs/src/lib.rs` and `packages/nlqdb-rb/lib/nlqdb.rb` are placeholder modules — no `db.create` method shipped — so there's nothing to wire `engine?` into yet. Per `GLOBAL-003`, when those SDKs land their first `db.create` method, that method exposes `engine?` directly (mirror of the TS shape: optional, classifier-default when absent, rejects unknown engines at the wire boundary with the API's `invalid_engine` 400). Tracker: this open question. Closes when the Rust + Ruby `db.create` slices ship.
- **`postChat` / `listChat` typed-error coverage.** The README enumerates the chat-related error codes; some are SDK-side sentinels (`network_error`, `aborted`) and may need reconciling with the API's canonical error catalog when chat surfaces formalize.
