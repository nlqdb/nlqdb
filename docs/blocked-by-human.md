# Blocked by Human

The single file the founder reads. Per [`GLOBAL-033`](./decisions/GLOBAL-033-resolution-defaults.md),
agents resolve value-decidable questions themselves; this file is **only** for
what a human must do — operator actions an agent can't perform (set a prod
secret, click through a console, prune a DB) and genuine money / strategy /
legal bets — or a suggestion needing human approval before it can amend the
guidelines. Keep each a very short bullet. Delete a bullet once done.

## Human actions (clicks, secrets, legal)

- **Stripe live-mode go-live** (deferred by founder 2026-06-12 — gated on the [`phase-plan.md §6`](phase-plan.md) demand signal: ≥5 inbound "how do I pay" OR ≥30% test-checkout completion over 50 sessions). Steps, all human: create live products + price IDs; add the live webhook endpoint (Dashboard → copy `whsec_…`); enable Stripe Tax in live mode; then `wrangler secret put` for `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` / `STRIPE_PRICE_HOBBY` / `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO` / `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Until then the flow stays in test mode and `/v1/billing/checkout` 503s.
- **Reddit ICP source** (deferred by founder 2026-06-12) — set `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` / `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` after manually approving a Reddit OAuth app (Reddit's Nov-2025 policy needs a human). The source self-skips until they're wired (`SK-ICP-011`).
