# Blocked by Human

The single file the founder reads. Per [`GLOBAL-033`](./decisions/GLOBAL-033-resolution-defaults.md),
agents resolve value-decidable questions themselves; this file is **only** for
what a human must do — operator actions an agent can't perform (set a prod
secret, click through a console, prune a DB) and genuine money / strategy /
legal bets — or a suggestion needing human approval before it can amend the
guidelines. Keep each a very short bullet. Delete a bullet once done.

## Human actions (clicks, secrets, legal)

- **Stripe live-mode go-live.** All human/live-mode Dashboard steps: create live products + price IDs; add the live webhook endpoint (copy `whsec_…`); enable Stripe Tax; save a live Customer-portal config (`/v1/billing/portal` errors without one). Then put the live `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` / `STRIPE_PRICE_HOBBY` / `STRIPE_PRICE_PRO` / `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` values in `.envrc`, run the mirror scripts, and trigger `deploy-api.yml` so the Worker picks them up.
- **Reddit ICP source** (deferred by founder 2026-06-12) — set `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` / `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` after manually approving a Reddit OAuth app (Reddit's Nov-2025 policy needs a human). The source self-skips until they're wired (`SK-ICP-011`).
- **Final legal copy for `/privacy` + `/terms`** — the live pages (`apps/web/src/pages/{privacy,terms}.astro`) are honest plain-English **pre-alpha drafts** of what we actually collect/do today. Before general availability, replace them with lawyer-reviewed text (decide on jurisdiction, GDPR/CCPA stance, data-retention specifics, and a real entity name).
- **Verify the `GEMINI_API_KEY` project has NO Cloud Billing account** (Google Cloud Console — human only) — the previous key was suspended 2026-06-15 after a *billed* project accrued a charge that went unpaid (we expected $0 per `GLOBAL-013`; a billed project bills even free-model calls). The 2026-06-17 key works today, but if its project has billing linked it will silently bill again and can be re-suspended. Confirm no billing account is attached (or unlink it) so the project is hard-capped to the free tier. See `docs/history/gemini-free-tier-billing-suspension.md`.
- **Privacy bet — feed sampled user cell-values to the free third-party LLM chain?** Today only schema DDL leaves the system (`apps/api/src/ask/orchestrate.ts` passes `db.schemaText`). The `value-retrieval` engine lever would additionally send a few real cell-values per column — a new data-exposure posture. Conservative default is **applied** (not built; `quality-eval/FEATURE.md` Open questions, run 18 showed it flips ~0 BIRD rows standalone anyway), so nothing is blocked — but if you want to revisit it as an engine lever, this is the call only you can make.
