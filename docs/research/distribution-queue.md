**Title:** The NULL timestamp that broke a TTL sweep and a funnel metric at
the same time

**Body:**

> A row in our `databases` registry has a `last_queried_at` column. Two
> unrelated systems read it: a daily sweep that evicts anonymous DBs whose
> `last_queried_at` is older than 90 days, and a funnel metric that counts
> "DBs that have ever returned an answer." Both quietly broke for the same
> reason, and the bug is worth sharing because it's a whole *class* of
> mistake, not a one-off.
>
> We added the column in a migration that backfilled existing rows
> (`UPDATE … SET last_queried_at = updated_at WHERE last_queried_at IS
> NULL`) — textbook. What we forgot: the `INSERT` on the create path never
> set the column. So every row created *after* the migration was `NULL`.
>
> Now watch both readers fail, differently:
>
> - **The sweep silently keeps everything.** `WHERE last_queried_at <
>   :cutoff` looks like it evicts old rows. But in SQL, `NULL < anything`
>   is `NULL`, which is not `TRUE`, so a `NULL` row never matches a
>   `<` predicate. The age-based eviction became a no-op for every new
>   row. No error, no log — the table just grows.
> - **The metric silently reads zero.** "DBs that returned an answer" was
>   `COUNT(*) WHERE last_queried_at IS NOT NULL`. Every new row is `NULL`,
>   so the metric is pinned at 0 regardless of what users actually did. We
>   nearly shipped a "fix" for a conversion problem that didn't exist —
>   the *instrument* was broken, not the funnel.
>
> Three takeaways:
>
> 1. **A backfill is not a default.** If a column needs a value, set it at
>    write time (a `DEFAULT`, or in every `INSERT`). A one-time backfill
>    fixes the past and nothing else.
> 2. **`NULL` is not "old" or "zero" — it's "unknown," and it poisons
>    comparisons.** Any `<`/`>`/`!=` against a nullable column has a third
>    outcome you have to design for. `COALESCE` at the read, or forbid the
>    `NULL`.
> 3. **Before "fixing" a metric that reads 0, prove the instrument can
>    ever read non-zero.** Ours structurally couldn't.
>
> (Context: this was in [nlqdb](https://nlqdb.com), a service that turns
> plain-English HTML components into SQL — the anonymous-DB sweep is how we
> keep the free tier's storage bounded. The fix was two lines: seed the
> column at create, re-run the backfill once.)

*Reviewer notes: pure engineering-story post, one product mention. Sourced
from this run's fix (`neon-provision.ts` + migration `0017`). Good fit for
dev.to (#sql #postgres #debugging) or lobste.rs (`databases`, `practices`).*

## 2026-06-13 — Show HN draft

**Title:** Show HN: nlqdb – HTML components that query a database in plain English

**Body:**

> I'm building nlqdb: you write HTML, each component asks for what it wants in
> plain English, and nlqdb answers — there's no backend to write. A
> `<nlq-data>` element (or the React/Vue/Svelte/etc. wrapper) carries a prompt
> like "the five most recent orders with customer names"; the service plans
> the SQL against your schema, validates it against a read-allowlist, runs it,
> and streams the rows back.
>
> The part I think is technically interesting: it runs on a chain of *free*
> LLMs (Cerebras, Gemini, Groq, Workers AI…), and the bet is that scaffolding
> — schema pruning, plan caching, structured-output fallbacks — compounds with
> the model, so being great on free models makes it invincible on frontier
> ones. Current honest numbers on that bet: BIRD execution accuracy 52.2%,
> Spider 17% (the Spider gap is mostly oversized-DDL handling, being worked).
> You can also bring your own LLM key (any tier, 0% markup) — it rides
> Cloudflare AI Gateway with the key sealed in an AES-256-GCM envelope.
>
> It's pre-alpha behind an invite gate, but the waitlist auto-invites
> instantly (weekly-capped to protect the free-LLM quota), so you can try it
> in under a minute: https://nlqdb.com
>
> Stack: Cloudflare Workers + D1/KV, Neon Postgres, OpenTelemetry throughout.
> BYO Postgres/ClickHouse is landing (the SSRF egress-guard work for that was
> a rabbit hole of IPv4-mapped IPv6 and decimal-encoded IPs). Happy to answer
> anything about the NL→SQL pipeline or the free-LLM routing.
