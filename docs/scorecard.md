# Scorecard — current state

Point-in-time tracker, regenerated each
[`/daily`](../.claude/commands/daily.md) run. Current state only — no changelog
(≤20 KB cap). History: `git log` +
`progress/quality-score-verification-log.md` (engine).

**Weekly focus number (2026-07-04 → 07-11):** **BIRD raw EX → ≥ 0.60**
(row #8) — 0.526 (07-05 canonical), still the only pillar below a hard
[`GLOBAL-025`](decisions/GLOBAL-025-north-star.md) Phase-2 floor;
`SK-QUAL-005` mandates engine work until it clears. Every agent-movable
sub-lever is now measured to a verdict (SC N≥2 flat #619; the run-15
frontier-clamp fix lifted agentic-frontier to 0.693, still < the 0.80 floor,
confirming run 14's ≤ 0.70 ceiling call); the only live BIRD-free move left is
the parked **corrected-set** (license, P2) — so row #8 is a floor this week
(**dark for the lever**, rule 8) and engine is also anti-rut-blocked (3 of the
last 5 merged daily PRs pulled it, rule 7).

**Worst number today:** real strangers reaching a first answer = **0** — a
lagging metric moved through its agent-movable inputs (distribution
surfaces/yield), **but the distribution lane was taken this cycle** by **PR
#633 (run 24, merged this cycle)** publishing `serverless-db-cold-start-retry`
(rows #6/#7/#18 + `blog.ts` + `distribution-queue.md`), so step-0 non-overlap
steered this run off distribution. **Today's lever (07-08, run 25): live-surface
claim integrity (row #19)** — found + closed **1 previously-blind
claim-vs-reality gap** on the `/pricing` free tier: *"Sleeps after 7 days idle"*
was ungoverned marketing copy (no SK, no code) contradicting the shipped
reality — free-tier Neon compute **scales to zero at Neon's ~5-min
auto-suspend** (`SK-ASK-013`; `index.ts:3446` keep-warm cron is *"strictly under
Neon's 5-min auto-suspend"*) and `db-sweep` explicitly *"never touches authed
user DBs"*, so no 7-day sleep exists anywhere. Fixed to *"Sleeps when idle ·
wakes in <2s"* (a straight code-wrong/reality-right bug fix per §10.2; the
web-app feature's core value is **Honest latency / no fake working claims** /
`GLOBAL-011`). Fresh lever category (claim integrity last pulled run 9), so
anti-rut-clear and off both the dark row #8 and the now-merged distribution
lane. Detail in *Last change*.
**Step-0 non-overlap:** #633 (run 24) merged this cycle — it owned `blog.ts` +
`distribution-queue.md` + scorecard rows #6/#7/#18; this run touches only
`apps/web/src/pages/pricing.astro` (one copy line) + scorecard row #19 /
header / Last-change — zero blog, zero queue, zero engine, zero API.
**Engine finding (row #8), standing:** offline deterministic-ceiling lever
exhausted (`SK-LLM-043` #605); SC dead (#619); frontier-lens levers closed
(run 15, `SK-QUAL-022`). **0.526 is a floor whose only live move is the parked
corrected-set** (Kang VLDB-2026; no license, P2). Phase 2 exit gate: **1/9
pass** (row #16).

| # | Metric | Value | Target / note |
|---|--------|-------|------|
| | **Funnel** (fresh 07-06 pull — CF GraphQL + remote D1) | | exclude synthetic stranger-test walker traffic |
| 1 | Visits, 7d (CF Web Analytics) | 83 visits / 104 pageloads (06-29→07-06, raw). **New walker filter (run 12):** grouping by `userAgentBrowser` splits out the walker UA (parses as "Unknown": 70 visits) ⇒ **real-browser ≈ 13 visits** (12 excl. ChromeHeadless) | account-level RUM can't split per-path, but the browser-dimension cut is a usable walker filter going forward; genuine-stranger signal is row #2 |
| 2 | Registered users, real strangers | 0 | 8 total = 4 founder/company + 4 test/dev (unchanged) |
| 3 | DBs total | 162, all with `last_queried_at`; latest 07-06 00:32 UTC | stranger subset still ~0 (row #2) |
| 4 | First-10-queries success rate (GLOBAL-025 onboarding KPI) | **stranger-only N = 0 → not yet measurable** (run 16, `SK-ONBOARD-007`, remote-D1 07-07). Unfiltered counters read 3/8 = **37.5%** but a `tenant_id → user.email` join shows all 3 rows are founder (`omer.hochman@gmail.com`) + `test@example.com` — the 35–37% previously reported was 100% non-stranger | target ≥ 95%. **Attribution gap fixed** (was "the instrument's next fix"): write-side skips the stranger-test walker UA (`isSyntheticUserAgent`, anon case the join can't see); read-side joins `user` + excludes founder/test. Honest read is now N=0 (matches row #2), not a placebo rate |
| 5 | Session retention (≥ 2 queries) | 3 DBs with `first10_asks ≥ 2` (same attribution caveat as row #4) | share of DBs with `first10_asks ≥ 2` (row #4 counters) |
| | **Distribution** — count *and* yield | | |
| 6 | Indexable surfaces | **85** (`/vs` 31 + `/solve` 33 + `/blog` 21) — run-24 lever: published `serverless-db-cold-start-retry` (SK-ASK-013 engine/ops lesson; build-verified `dist/blog/serverless-db-cold-start-retry/index.html`, in `llms.txt` + `sitemap.xml`, 104 → 105 built pages). Oldest ready draft drained (step 3, queue was ≥ 3). Queue drains **3 → 2** (`blog-without-a-feed-is-a-dead-end` [run 22] + `one-way-internal-links-leak-yield` [run 19] remain; < 3 ⇒ next run drafts) | leading input to rows #1–#3; `llms.txt` + sitemap auto-aggregate |
| 7 | Surface yield | posts 21 (run 24: +`serverless-db-cold-start-retry`); 7d external referrals = **1** (`bing.com`, 1 pageload). **Run 22 lever: syndication feeds 0 → 1** — shipped `/rss.xml` (hand-rolled RSS 2.0 over `data/blog.ts`, autodiscovered site-wide via `<link rel="alternate">`; build-verified `dist/rss.xml` = valid feed, all 20 posts, 5 passing invariants in `rss.xml.test.ts`). Closes the "un-subscribable blog" gap: feed readers can now subscribe and dev.to/Medium/Hashnode can auto-import the canonical copy (each re-post carries `rel=canonical` back). External-referral re-measure lags a window (indexation/syndication pickup). **Run 19 lever: internal-link reciprocity 0 → 10** — `/blog` posts forward-linked to their `/solve`/`/vs` anchor, but those pages never linked back (link graph a tree, not a mesh). Added the reciprocal "Further reading" backlink on all 10 anchored `/solve`+`/vs` pages (`blogByAnchorPath`, same `anchor` field), so every published post now has ≥1 internal inbound link + visitors get a next hop. Internal links 2417 → 2427 (row #18) | CF `refererHost` — measured every run. Attacks the standing "volume without yield" finding at its SEO/UX input; external-referral re-measure lands next window (indexation lags) |

## Last change

**2026-07-08 (run 25)** — lever: **live-surface claim integrity (row #19)** —
found + closed **1 previously-blind claim-vs-reality gap**. Row #8 (weekly
focus) is dark for the lever (rule 8) + engine anti-rut-blocked (rule 7); the
worst-number input (distribution) was **taken this cycle** by PR #633 (run 24,
merged this cycle), so step-0 non-overlap steered off it to the next
agent-movable, non-dark, non-overlapping lever. **Gap:** `/pricing` Free tier
claimed *"Sleeps after 7 days idle"* — the **only occurrence repo-wide**,
governed by no SK/doc and implemented by no code. Reality: free-tier Neon
compute **scales to zero at Neon's ~5-min auto-suspend** (`SK-ASK-013`; the
keep-warm cron at `apps/api/src/index.ts:3446` is *"strictly under Neon's 5-min
auto-suspend"* and pings only the platform `DATABASE_URL`, not user DBs), and
`db-sweep` *"never touches authed user DBs"* (anon 90-day deletion only). No
7-day sleep exists. **Fix:** one copy line → *"Sleeps when idle · wakes in
<2s"* — a code-wrong / reality-right bug fix (§10.2) inside the web-app core
value (**Honest latency / no fake claims** / `GLOBAL-011`); the honest `<2s`
wake bound stays (Neon resume; `SK-ASK-013` ≤ 900 ms + query). P1 checked: no
decision exists to contradict, so no supersede. **Measured:**
found-and-closed-same-run (run-9 pattern) ⇒ tracked gaps **net 0**;
`check:links` 105 pages / 2,580 links / **0 dead, 0 redirecting** (row #18
unchanged). **KPI:** GLOBAL-025 **UX/trust** — a live pricing surface now
matches shipped behavior. **None degrade:** `typecheck` + `lint` clean,
`apps/web` `test` 233/233, build 105 pages clean; zero engine/API/blog/queue
touched, baselines byte-untouched.
