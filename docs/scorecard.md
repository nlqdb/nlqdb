# Scorecard — current state

Point-in-time tracker, regenerated each
[`/daily`](../.claude/commands/daily.md) run. Current state only — no changelog
(≤20 KB cap). History: `git log` +
`progress/quality-score-verification-log.md` (engine).

**Weekly focus number (2026-07-19 → 07-25, founder-set):**
**Acquisition — channels live with attributable yield: 2 → ≥ 5 (row #22).**
Founder directive 2026-07-19 ([`GLOBAL-038`](decisions/GLOBAL-038-gtm-pmf-instrumentation.md)):
the operating focus is **user acquisition**, measured continuously — product
progress is secondary this cycle. The agent-movable inputs, in order: reach
R-05 registry listings (0/8 → list or park each), R-04 machine-followable
setup guide (registries' prerequisite), utm-tagging the already-live channels
(dev.to, npm/GitHub READMEs) per `SK-GTM-007`, and R-06 (the track's
falsifier). Channel truth lives in
[`research/acquisition-channels.md`](research/acquisition-channels.md); yield
truth on `/app/admin` (first-touch attribution shipped 07-19 — the first
stranger cohort will be attributable from day one). This supersedes the
morning's agentic-frontier focus: premium-chain work (`SK-LLM-017`, row #20)
is pullable only when no acquisition lever is. **Row #15 stays
founder-blocked** — its only fix is arming `FALLBACK2_LLM_API_KEY`
(SambaNova, `_e2e-opencheck.yml`), the top `blocked-by-human.md` bullet.

**Worst number today:** **row #16 Phase-2 exit gate 1/9**; worst engine number is
**row #9 Spider 0.2222** and **row #8 BIRD 0.542** — both dark + fresh (07-19), offline
levers exhausted. **The weekly-focus number (row #22) is now pullable:** the PRs that
held it last run — #750 (npm → live) and #751 (MCP-registry venue) — are **merged**, so
the priority-1 acquisition lever no longer collides. **Run 101 pulled it** (priority-1
acquisition): the GitHub channel was the sole `partial` in the ledger; its next-step
listed "utm-tag README links" as a `/daily` input (the weekly focus assigns
topics/templates to `/reach`, not the tagging). Tagged the root README's single product
CTA `https://nlqdb.com/?utm_source=github`, mirroring run 99's npm flip — GitHub
click-throughs are now `captureFirstTouch`-attributable ⇒ **row #22 3 → 4 live, 0
partial.** **Step 0 collision map:** only open PR is #719 (Infisical draft — founder
territory, untouched). This run touched `README.md` + `docs/research/acquisition-channels.md`
+ `docs/scorecard.md` — **no overlap** (scorecard regen exempt). **Rule 6:** CI +
Security + Deploy web/docs/MCP/API all `success` on `main` head `012904d` (fresh 07-20);
Canary `success` on `39aef4b`; no red-main / stale-deploy lever.

The stranger create→ask→first-answer path is hardened each run (vague-goal recovery, aborted-reply settle, create-result + magic-link a11y); **run 98** stopped `getOrMintAnonToken` hard-throwing when localStorage is blocked (privacy modes) — the one anon slot bypassing the SK-ANON-011 `safeStorage` in-memory fallback, so a cookie-blocked stranger's create died on a misleading "Couldn't reach the API"; now degrades to an in-memory token (rows #4/#5).

## Last change

**2026-07-20 (run 102)** — **Priority-2 UX-flow lever (row #4): the create-result screen now
reports the *provisioned* schema, not the LLM-seeded subset.** Weekly-focus number (row #22) is
**held by open PR** #753 (GitHub → live, 3 → 4, edits the acquisition ledger) — per **step 0**
the priority-1 lever can't be pulled without duplicating it; reach #754 holds the agent-artifacts
surface. Engine lanes dark + fresh (07-19). Defect-hunt over the stranger create→first-answer
path found a genuine drift: **both create-result renderers (`CreateForm.tsx` + `chat/ChatPanel.tsx`)
derived the table count *and* the per-table preview from `sampleRows`** — but that seed set is
LLM-authored and SK-HDC-018/019 make it partial or empty. A 3-table DB seeded only on `orders`
showed "1 table" (hiding `customers`/`products`); a fully-unseeded-but-committed DB showed a green
**"0 sample rows across 0 tables"** — indistinguishable from total failure at the stranger's first
"did it work?" moment (SK-HDC-001). **Change (P5 — carry the truth, consolidate):** the create
response now ships the provisioned table list (`DbCreatePlanSummary.tables` ←
`plan.tables.map(t=>t.name)`); one new shared `groupProvisionedTables(tables, rows)` in
`sample-rows.ts` renders one group per provisioned table (seeded rows where present, else
SampleTable's empty state) and **both** renderers call it, replacing the two divergent
`groupByTable` sites. **Number moved — row #4:** guard-the-guard confirmed — pre-fix
(`groupByTable` on `sampleRows`) yields `["orders"]` where the contract needs all 3 tables
(fails); web **337 → 341 pass** (+4: partial-seed, fully-unseeded, schema-order, pre-field
fallback); `orchestrate.test.ts` pins `plan.tables:["orders"]`. No new doc (D5 — extends
SK-HDC-018/019's "never claims rows it doesn't hold" to "never under-claims tables"). **Gates:**
typecheck exit 0; touched files biome-clean; astro check **0/0**; web **341**, api **974** pass.
**Step-1:** docs-ambiguity **16** (flat); surfaces **105**, queue **2**; users **9** / strangers
**0** (07-16 carried); GSC 28d **1/472/16.6** fresh 07-20; BIRD 0.542 / Spider 0.2222 (07-19).
**Artifact:** queue **2** (< 3) → no publish; dev.to drip **throttled** (6.2h ago < 20h, run 100
posted today); no new draft (queue at D4 cap). **KPI (GLOBAL-025):** **onboarding + UX** — a
stranger sees every table their DB has, and a schema-only DB reads as success not failure; **no
KPI degrades** (additive response field + one shared pure helper; no engine/API/funnel logic
touched).
