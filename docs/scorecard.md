# Scorecard — current state

Point-in-time tracker, regenerated each
[`/daily`](../.claude/commands/daily.md) run. Current state only — no changelog
(≤20 KB cap). History: `git log` +
`progress/quality-score-verification-log.md` (engine).

**Weekly focus number (2026-07-18 → 07-25):**
**row #8 BIRD raw EX → ≥ 0.60** — the pillar furthest from its
[`GLOBAL-025`](decisions/GLOBAL-025-north-star.md) floor. The `SK-LLM-044` detour
is now closed: measured on BIRD (run 90 — regressed), reverted, and run 91
**confirmed the revert recovered the number** (0.514 → 0.542, PR #734 merged) —
see below. **Row #15 stays founder-blocked** — its only fix is arming
`FALLBACK2_LLM_API_KEY` (SambaNova, `_e2e-opencheck.yml`), an operator-only
action **restored to `blocked-by-human.md` this week** after PR #714 deleted the
bullet while the secret was still unset (this week's `weekly-review.md`, worst
finding).

**Worst number today:** **row #16 Phase-2 exit gate 1/9**; within engine, **row #8
BIRD 0.542 < the 0.60 Phase-2 floor** (gap 5.8 pp). The weekly-focus engine lever
(row #8) is resolved — **run 91 (PR #734, merged): the post-revert canonical BIRD
re-measure recovered 0.514 → 0.5422** (McNemar b=36/c=34 p=0.452, `regressions:
[]` — the run-90 `SK-QUAL-006` trigger cleared; baseline re-seeded 0.5462 →
0.5422, a flat give-back per `SK-QUAL-005`). The engine lever is fresh (07-19) and
flat; offline levers exhausted. Per **step 0** run 92's row-#4 lever is merged, so
**run 93 pulled a step-2 priority-1 UX-flow lever (rows #4/#5, chat ask path):**
when a stranger asks a follow-up before their first answer lands, the new send
aborts the in-flight request (`ChatPanel` `startSend`, SK-SDK-003) — but the
aborted reply's catch did `if (ac.signal.aborted) return;` **without settling the
reply**, leaving reply #1 a perpetual `pending` skeleton spinning above the newer
answer (a GLOBAL-011 spinner-lie) *and* silently blocking the whole session from
persisting (the history save effect skips while any reply is pending → on reload
the entire session rewrote to "Session ended."). Fixed: the abort branch now
settles the superseded reply to a terminal `error` ("Cancelled — replaced by a
newer question."); extracted the settle rule into a pure, unit-tested
`reply-settle.ts` (same discipline as `trace-steps.ts`) and routed `loadHistory`'s
identical "Session ended." rewrite through it (de-dup). **Step 0:** open PRs #731
(weekly docs) and #719 (Infisical draft) remain; this run touched only
`apps/web/src/components/chat/{ChatPanel.tsx,reply-settle.*}` — no overlap;
scorecard regen is overlap-exempt. **Rule 6:** CI + deploy-web green on `main`
(`04fa3d0`); no red-main / stale-deploy lever.

## Last change

**2026-07-19 (run 93)** — **UX-flow lever (step-2 priority 1, rows #4/#5, chat ask
path): an aborted in-flight reply spun a loading skeleton forever and silently
blocked the whole session from persisting; settled it + de-duped the settle rule.**
Run 92's row-#4 lever is merged (per **step 0** not duplicated), so this run pulled
the next priority-1 stranger-flow defect (surfaced by an `Explore` sweep of the
create→ask→first-answer path). When a stranger asks a follow-up **before their
first answer lands**, `ChatPanel.startSend` aborts the in-flight request
(SK-SDK-003, single-in-flight model). But the aborted call's catch was
`if (ac.signal.aborted) return;` — it bailed **without settling the reply**, so
reply #1 stayed `{ kind: "pending" }` forever: a perpetual Answer/Data skeleton
(`aria-busy`) spinning above the newer answer (a **GLOBAL-011** spinner-lie), and —
because the history save effect skips while any reply is `pending` — the entire
session never persisted to `localStorage`, so a reload rewrote all of it to
"Session ended.". The closure's `replyId` is always the *superseded* reply (a
newer send's id differs), so settling it can't clobber the live one. **Fix:** the
abort branch now settles the superseded reply to a terminal
`error` "Cancelled — replaced by a newer question."; extracted the settle rule
into a pure, unit-tested `reply-settle.ts` (structural-typing discipline of
`trace-steps.ts`) and routed `loadHistory`'s identical non-terminal→"Session
ended." rewrite through the same predicate (de-dup, net −6 lines in `ChatPanel`).
**Number:** rows #4/#5 (onboarding / retention) — the follow-up-before-answer path
went from **orphaned perpetual spinner + lost session history → terminal state +
history persists**; behavior locked by 3 new `reply-settle.test.ts` cases (aborted
`pending` → error; terminal states untouched). **Gates:** `bun test src` (web)
**295 pass** (290 + 5 new); changed files tsc-clean (only pre-existing
`react`/`@nlqdb/sdk` module-resolution noise); biome clean; scorecard < 20 KB (D4).
**Step-1 refresh:** nothing merged since run 92 → CI + deploy-web `success` on
`main` `04fa3d0`; docs-ambiguity **15**; `/blog` **36**, queue **2**; users **9** /
strangers **0** carried (07-16, newest reg 07-06); GSC 28d **1 click / 452 impr /
pos 16.3** carried (row #7). **Artifact (step 3):** queue **2** (< 3) → no forced
publish; **dev.to drip fired** (> 20 h since last) — posted the oldest pending
variant `zep-recall-vs-analytical-agent-memory` →
https://dev.to/omer_hochman/zep-gives-my-agent-perfect-recall-it-still-cant-answer-average-per-group-about-its-own-memory-3ae0
(tags `ai,agents,database`; archive-only pointer, no queue-line venue to edit —
the script's API dedup self-updates); no new draft (optional, queue at the D4
edge, 19.7 KB). **KPI (GLOBAL-025):** **onboarding + UX** — an impatient stranger's
first session no longer breaks into a frozen spinner or loses its history; no KPI
degrades (client-only settle + tests, no engine/API surface touched).
