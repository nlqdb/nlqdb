# Scorecard

Regenerated daily by [`/daily`](../.claude/commands/daily.md) step 1 from live
sources (D1, KV, CF GraphQL, `eval-baseline.ts`). One table; soft 5 KB cap
**relaxed while the agent-memory pivot is in flight** (GLOBAL-036) — the
20-row Pivot section mirrors [`agent-memory-pivot/worksheets/INDEX.md`](features/agent-memory-pivot/worksheets/INDEX.md)
so every WS-* / E-* status is visible at a glance; the section collapses
back to a one-line summary once the pivot completes. Published distribution
URLs land here when a queue entry ships.

**Weekly focus number:** *(none set — founder picks at the weekly session;
until then the daily lever targets the worst number below)*

**Worst number today:** real strangers reaching a first answer = **0**
(funnel/distribution lane) — gated by the engine (GLOBAL-027 valve), so the
engine-side worst, **Spider 0.1852 vs 0.75**, owns it. The bottleneck is **SQL
reasoning** (mismatches), not provider availability (Gemini healed 06-17,
`SK-LLM-039`) nor literal grounding (`SK-QUAL-014`: `literal_only` = 0). BIRD
re-run 06-19 is **flat** (0.522 → 0.520, McNemar p=0.50) ⇒ directive levers
(T13–T22) **saturated**; the path to the gate floor is the §4 **reasoning**
levers (#1 DAIL-SQL retrieval, #3 self-consistency), both **built end-to-end
and dispatchable** but **dispatch-gated today** (both evals < 7 d, §5). The
DAIL-SQL **selector** half is at its **offline ceiling** (run 52: q8/q10 ICP
misses falsified as selector-tweak-unfixable; held-out precision@1 **14/14**),
but **pool-exemplar curation stays a live offline lever** — run 74 landed
persona-bench q21 (rephrasing the `count-distinct` demo off the SQL keyword
"distinct" → the natural "different"), then run 76 landed q20 (reframing the
`scalar-subquery` demo from the stilted "List the names of products priced
above…" to the natural "Which products are priced above the average price? List
the product names") — both **exemplar-phrasing leaks**, not selector gaps
(own-ICP precision@1 **18/23 → 20/23**, held-out still 14/14). The only remaining
offline #1 gain beyond pool curation is SQL-skeleton similarity (an LLM
round-trip, not a daily lever) or the gated dispatch. **Run 58** fired the first persona-bench
dispatch (`quality-eval-persona-bench.yml`, now on `main`): the free chain
scores **0.90 EX (18/20) on the ICP shape** (row 8) — **1.7× BIRD, 4.9× Spider**
— quantifying the GLOBAL-026 bet that clean product-shaped schemas are already
solved on free LLMs, so the engine bottleneck is the messy *academic* shape, not
the user's. The **frontier** lane (row 9, the headline delta) is **secret-blocked,
not dispatch-blocked**: `OPENROUTER_FRONTIER_API_KEY` is empty in CI — filed in
`blocked-by-human.md`; the delta lands the instant the founder sets it.

| # | Metric | Value | Target / note |
|---|--------|-------|------|
| | **Funnel — bot-filtered, 2026-06-22 (live re-pull)** | | walkers = `flow-004-walker` source / `nlqdb-flow004-*` emails |
| 1 | Visits, 7d (CF Web Analytics) | 62 visits / 98 pageloads | was 94/147 (06-15); walker traffic still aging out of the 7d window |
| 2 | Waitlist rows, real | 1 of 79 | 78 walker/test/probe; the 1 is the founder → ~0 genuine strangers |
| 3 | Registered users, real strangers | 0 | 7 total = 3 founder/company + 4 test/dev accounts |
| 4 | Invite-valve crossings (KV `wl:invite-cap`) | 9/wk (06-13, carried) | cap 200/wk — no exhaustion risk; mostly walker-triggered; not re-pulled this run |
| 5 | Anon DBs with a recorded first answer | **113 of 113** | instrument fix (runs 1–3) holding; +12 since 06-15 (119 DBs total, 6 authed). Genuine-stranger subset still ~0 (rows #2/#3) — the real worst-number |
| | **Engine — BIRD 2026-06-19 (< 7d) · Spider 2026-06-17 (at 7-day edge on 06-24) · persona-bench 2026-06-22** | | `apps/api/src/gate/eval-baseline.ts` (BIRD/Spider only; persona-bench never overwrites the canonical baseline, `SK-QUAL-018`). Spider re-dispatch is due next run once it crosses 7d; last run completed clean on main (no resumable checkpoint), so it will be a fresh windowed run, not a resume |
| 6 | BIRD raw EX | 0.520 | target 0.65; was 0.522 (06-12). Canonical re-run on current main (T20–T22): 260/500, `no_sql` 3 → 1. **Flat within variance** — McNemar b=38/c=37, p=0.50, no regression. Directive levers saturated; literal/value (§4 #2a) + date-encoding (§4 #2c) levers both falsified standalone offline (run 31) ⇒ reasoning levers (§4 #3/#1) next |
| 7 | Spider raw EX | 0.1852 | target 0.75; was 0.1704 (06-12). Gemini key restored 06-17 → `no_sql` 36 → 9 (`SK-LLM-039`). Run 33: external-knowledge injection (`SK-QUAL-016`). **Self-consistency `SK-QUAL-017` (§4 #3): vote core (34) + execution half (37) + temperature-sampling half (run 40) + **runner `--self-consistency N` / `--sc-temperature T` main-loop wiring (run 41)** — `samples>=2` branch in `runOneQuestion` (separate from `withExecRetry`): `samplePlans`→`voteOverSamples` over `executeRows`→score-the-winner; folds into checkpoint/budget-stop/`attempts`, `.scN` checkpoint variant. The lever is now end-to-end bar the CI `workflow_dispatch` input. EX delta next dispatch** |
| 8 | persona-bench free-chain EX | **0.90 (18/20)** | full-chain ICP EX (run 58 GHA 27983818047; **run 63 reproduced it locally**). **1.7× BIRD, 4.9× Spider** — GLOBAL-026 bet. **Single N=20 runs are ±1 noisy** — misses flake across legs/runs (q8/q11/q18) as failover assigns models per run — so canonical N=500 BIRD/Spider (dispatch-gated <7d) stay the only *powered* engine levers. Run 63 root-caused the one **stable** miss q8: a **tie-fragile gold**, not an engine gap — `score.ts` is sequence-strict on `ORDER BY` golds and q8 tied two facts at count 2, so the weak llama leg (`GROUP BY object`) false-mismatched gold (`GROUP BY f.id`); fixed tie-free (`SK-QUAL-019`, fixture-only). Batch 3 (run 68) 20 → 23 q, gold-exec 23/23 (GHA 0.90 was on 20 q; local throttled 21/23); retrieval precision@1 18/20 → 18/23 (run 68) → 19/23 (run 74) → **20/23** (run 76: q20 landed by reframing the `scalar-subquery` demo to the natural "Which products are priced above the average price? List the product names"; both q21+q20 were exemplar-phrasing leaks, not selector gaps; held-out still 14/14; 3 residual misses q8/q10/q22 stay selector-side) |
| 9 | free-vs-frontier delta | null *(secret-blocked, not dispatch-blocked)* | run 58 dispatched persona-bench with `include_frontier=true`, but the job log shows `OPENROUTER_FRONTIER_API_KEY:` resolves **empty** → only the free lane built, `free_vs_frontier_delta=null`. Root-caused + filed in `blocked-by-human.md` (founder sets the repo secret). The dispatch path itself is proven working; the delta lands the moment the key is set. Agentic lane also not yet run (`SK-QUAL-004`, target ≤ 25 pp) |

## Deltas (recent runs)

- 2026-06-24 (run 80) — **Distribution: shipped
  `/solve/store-query-chatbot-conversation-history` (8th solve page, P2
  agent-builder, the conversation-transcript + engagement-analytics wedge).**
  Comparison-pages (#498 cognee) and gate-removal (#496) lanes were in open
  PRs; engine offline-retrieval is exhausted (persona-bench precision@1 20/23,
  3 residuals selector-side); canonical BIRD/Spider dispatch-gated (BIRD 06-19
  < 7d, Spider 06-17 only at the 7-day edge on 06-24, last run clean on main =
  fresh windowed run not a resume → deferred, due next run). So this run took
  the non-colliding **solve-pages** lane (distinct files from #498). The page
  targets a distinct high-volume search ("store/query chatbot conversation
  history") and the GLOBAL-036 "a database, not a vector store" wedge: a vector
  store recalls the most-similar message but has no query planner, so
  "messages per day"/"most active users" become the LLM doing arithmetic over
  search hits — nlqdb runs the `GROUP BY` in Postgres and shows the SQL. Honest
  limits stated (no semantic search, no BYO-Postgres, no PII redaction). **Δ:**
  solve pages **7 → 8** (P2 3 → 4); llms.txt/sitemap +1; FAQPage+HowTo+
  BreadcrumbList JSON-LD all verified in `dist/`. **KPI:** onboarding /
  distribution; **none degraded** — one data object + doc edits, no
  engine/funnel/ops file touched; 130 web tests + astro-check 0 errors + biome
  clean. Doc-hygiene rider: `distribution-queue.md` kept under the 20 KB cap
  (run-77 collapsed, superseded run-74 line dropped).
- 2026-06-24 (run 79) — **Distribution: shipped `/vs/cognee` (18th comparison
  page; P2 knowledge-graph wing of the agent-memory wedge).** Non-colliding
  AEO lane (engine offline-retrieval exhausted at persona-bench precision@1
  20/23, canonical BIRD/Spider dispatch-gated, gate-removal in #496). Cognee is
  the highest-keyword uncovered memory framework that is explicitly *not a
  vector store* (hybrid vector + knowledge-graph recall) — the GLOBAL-036 pivot
  headline; honest wedge: it recalls graph-connected context but ships no SQL
  layer, its KG construction + Apache-2.0 self-host conceded `them: shipped`;
  facts web-verified. **Δ:** comparison pages 17 → 18, memory /vs 8 → 9,
  llms.txt/sitemap +1, OG +1; FAQPage+BreadcrumbList+SoftwareApplication in
  `dist/`. **KPI:** onboarding / distribution; **none degraded** — one typed
  data object + doc anchors + one PNG; 130 web + 13 invariants + biome green.
- 2026-06-23 (runs 77–78) — **AEO structured-data wave (both merged; engine
  dispatch-gated, none degraded).** Run 78: every `/vs` + `/solve` page now
  emits `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD + a visible breadcrumb trail (shared
  `lib/breadcrumb.ts`, trailing-slash `item` URLs matching the run-69 canonical
  fix; visible `<nav>` matches markup per Google's rule) — **0 → 24 pages**.
  Run 77: the hand-authored `/agents` lead-wedge front door (the only key
  landing page without it) now emits `FAQPage` JSON-LD from a typed `faqs`
  array (visible `<dl>` + schema, can't drift; every answer restates on-page
  copy) — site `FAQPage` pages **24 → 25**. Both additive static structured
  data; 130 web tests + astro-check clean.
- 2026-06-23 (runs 74–76) — **Engine pool-curation + distribution wave (all
  merged; engine canonical dispatch-gated, BIRD 06-19 / Spider 06-17 untouched;
  none degraded).** Two DAIL-SQL pool-curation fixes (the offline retrieval
  instrument): run 74 q21 (COUNT DISTINCT — `count-distinct` demo echoed the SQL
  keyword "distinct" while users say "different"), run 76 q20 (scalar `> AVG()` —
  `scalar-subquery` demo read as a bare "List the names…" sharing none of q20's
  `which`/`list`/`names` tokens). Both **exemplar-phrasing leaks**, not the
  run-52-falsified selector-code tweak — own-ICP retrieval precision@1 **18/23 →
  19/23 → 20/23**, held-out **14/14** held (generalises, not tuned to the
  question); prod byte-identical (`buildPlanSystem` default-off), baselines
  byte-untouched. 3 residual misses (q8/q10/q22) confirmed selector-side. Run 75:
  shipped `/solve/database-claude-cursor-can-query` (solve pages 6 → 7). Detail:
  `quality-score-verification-log.md` + git.
- 2026-06-23 (runs 67–73) — **Distribution + doc-hygiene wave (all merged;
  engine dispatch-gated, BIRD 06-19 / Spider 06-17 untouched; none degraded).**
  **Distribution (AEO):** `/vs/retool` (run 67, internal-tools builder),
  `/vs/basedash` (run 70 — repositioned to AI-native BI, stale P4 row corrected),
  `/vs/metabase` (run 72 — Metabase Metabot, P3 OSS-BI moat), comparison pages
  **14 → 17**, facts web-verified, honest builder/BI-over-existing-DB-vs-own-the-DB
  wedge each. **Engine instrument (run 68):** persona-bench 20 → 23, gold-exec
  23/23 (SK-QUAL-018; 3 new SK-QUAL-014 shapes, selector-side misses, baselines
  byte-untouched). **AEO hygiene (run 69):** `trailingSlash: "always"` + canonical/
  og:url/sitemap/llms.txt normalize → sitemap 200/307 **1/27 → 28/0**.
  **Doc-hygiene (run 73, D4+D5+P3):** `runbook.md` −766 B + `competitors.md`
  −40 B (run 70 rider), both net-shrunk under D4, prod byte-identical.
- 2026-06-23 (runs 62, 65, 66) — **Doc-hygiene wave (D4 + D5 + P3), prod
  byte-identical.** Run 66 net-shrank the largest D4 violation,
  `hosted-db-create/FEATURE.md` 35,376 → 34,099 B (−1,277 B): D5
  implementation-narration in `Consequence in code` (line numbers, test-case
  lists, span names the GLOBAL-014 section already owns, Decision restatements) →
  the load-bearing invariant + its enforcing review rule; 20 SK-HDC-* intact, §8
  gate clean. Run 65 `ask-pipeline/FEATURE.md` −1,257 B (22 SK-ASK-* intact); run
  62 `anonymous-mode/FEATURE.md` −3,974 B (14 SK-ANON-* intact). **KPI:**
  onboarding; **none degraded** — docs-only.
- 2026-06-23 (runs 61, 64) — **Distribution: shipped `/vs/qdrant` (closing the
  canonical vector-DB cluster Pinecone/Chroma/Weaviate/Qdrant) + `/vs/julius`
  (first P3-analyst comparison), both AEO levers while engine stayed
  dispatch-gated.** Comparison pages **12 → 14**, P2 cluster 7 → 8, OG cards
  8 → 9, llms.txt/sitemap +2; facts web-verified. None degraded — data objects
  + one PNG, no engine/funnel/ops file touched.
- 2026-06-22 (runs 59–60) — distribution + hygiene wave (all merged; BIRD 06-19 /
  Spider 06-17 untouched). **Distribution (run 59):** shipped `/vs/weaviate`, the
  enterprise/hybrid-search wing of the "database, not a vector store" wedge —
  comparison pages 11 → 12, P2 cluster 6 → 7, OG cards 7 → 8, llms.txt/sitemap +1;
  same aggregation wedge (hybrid search ranks; no GROUP BY/JOIN/HAVING), facts
  web-verified. **Hygiene (run 60, D4+P1/P3):** `docs/architecture.md` net-shrunk
  + fixed §3.6.4/§3.6.5 restating superseded decisions (`SK-ASK-003`/`SK-HDC-005`/
  `SK-HDC-006`) → invariant + pointer, 0 lost. None degraded; prod byte-identical.
- 2026-06-22 (runs 55–58) — persona-bench + distribution + hygiene wave (all
  merged; BIRD 06-19 / Spider 06-17 untouched). **Engine (runs 55, 58):** shipped
  `quality-eval-persona-bench.yml` (SK-QUAL-018 "last half", ungated by
  `SK-QUAL-002` — no baseline/fixture/emit), then fired the first post-merge
  dispatch → free-chain **EX 0.90 (18/20)** on the ICP shape (row 8; **1.7× BIRD,
  4.9× Spider**, GHA 27983818047); both Groq-leg misses are challenging multi-join
  aggregations (q13 the `SK-QUAL-014` `literal_diff`, q18 a `LEFT JOIN` vs the gold
  inner-join). Frontier lane (row 9) **secret-blocked, not dispatch-blocked** —
  `OPENROUTER_FRONTIER_API_KEY` empty in CI; filed in `blocked-by-human.md`.
  **Distribution (run 56):** shipped `/vs/chroma` (OSS-first vector-store wing) —
  comparison pages 10 → 11, P2 cluster 5 → 6, same aggregation wedge.
  **Hygiene (run 57, D4+D5+P3):** `docs/performance.md` net-shrunk 26,378 →
  24,441 B (collapsed §4's stale slice-by-slice plan into the standing rule; 0
  span/metric names lost). None degraded; prod byte-identical.
- 2026-06-22 (runs 51–54) — engine + distribution + hygiene wave (all merged;
  BIRD 06-19 / Spider 06-17 untouched): DAIL-SQL pool 13 → 14 (+`order-by-limit`,
  ICP precision@1 18/20); run 52 falsified the lexical-selector avenue for the
  q8/q10 misses (Δ ≤ 0 reverted) ⇒ §4 #1 pool/lexical half at its **offline
  ceiling**; shipped `/vs/pinecone` (comparison pages 9 → 10); `docs/progress.md`
  net-shrunk under the cap. None degraded. (Detail: verification log + git.)
- 2026-06-22 (runs 48–50) — engine + distribution + hygiene wave (all merged;
  BIRD 06-19 + Spider 06-17 untouched): DAIL-SQL pool 12 → 13 (+`null-filter`,
  ICP precision@1 17/20 → 18/20); 5 `/vs` pages dropped a phantom MCP
  `create_database` verb (web tests 11 → 13); `quality-score-source-of-truth.md`
  net-shrunk under the D4 cap. None degraded. (Detail: verification log + git.)
- 2026-06-21/22 (runs 37–47) — engine + distribution + hygiene staging wave (all
  merged/additive; BIRD 06-19 + Spider 06-17 untouched). **Engine:** §4 #1
  DAIL-SQL retrieval built end-to-end offline (`few-shot-select.ts` value-mask +
  Jaccard + top-k, schema-aware selector, `buildPlanSystem(goal,schema,k)`,
  curated pool → 12 buckets, `SK-LLM-041`, precision@1 12/12); §4 #3
  self-consistency (`SK-QUAL-017`, runner `--self-consistency`/`--sc-temperature`,
  default greedy byte-identical); persona-bench → dispatchable `EvalDataset` 20
  golds (`SK-QUAL-018`). **Distribution:** WS-08 OG cards (SK-PIVOT-012), WS-09
  gate-honest `/agents` demo, WS-12 → messaging 11/13, pivot 13/20. **Hygiene:**
  `distribution-queue.md` 35.9 → 9.1 KB. Plus E-04 TTL-sweep core (`SK-PIVOT-011`)
  + SK-PIVOT-010 finding. KPI engine quality / onboarding; none degraded.
- 2026-06-19/20 (runs 19–36) — agent-memory pivot launch wave + engine staging
  (all closed/additive; BIRD 06-19 + Spider 06-17 untouched). Messaging → 8/13,
  pivot → 10/20 (competitors anchor, memory `/vs` pages, `/agents`
  skeleton+hero+matrix+CTA, launch post, FSL self-host copy). Engine: **E-01**
